            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Nnumerable are the benefits (moſt Renowned and moſt mightie Lords) which haue happened to your Prouinces by the goodneſſe of God, and are ſupplyed to you, as it were <hi>by the immediate prouidence of God.</hi> Theſe are great things, that your Common-wealth, flouriſhing with Riches, inlarged with Territories, potent by ſea and land, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the Artes both of Warre and Peace, hath ſo beaten backe the force of a moſt mighty enemy, that you haue alwayes waged warre on your enemyes ground, and your Cities in the midſt of the <hi>heate</hi> of the warres, enioyed Halcion-dayes of Peace. All which are done by the authority of your moſt Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Senate, and by the conduct of the Prince of ORENGE; of whoſe prayſes it is better to be ſilent
<pb facs="tcp:11390:4"/>then to ſpeake but little. Euen they who enuy your good ſucceſſes, doe yet admire your vertue. Finally, your Common-wealth hath had ſuch a Senate, and ſuch Princes, as God doth giue whenſoeuer hee will aduance poore and afflicted eſtates, to the higheſt top of power and glory.</p>
            <p>But among the other benefits of God, this is moſt eminent, that when the bottomleſſe pit doth caſt out that thicke ſmoake, which couereth almoſt the whole world in a thicke miſt of ignorance, amongſt you the Sunne of Truth doth clearely ſhine in his pure orbe, and hath ſcattered the darknes of ignorance. Whence it is come to paſſe that your country, together with ciuill bondage, hath ſhaken off the yoke layd vpon your conſciences.</p>
            <p>Sathan, that hee might hinder the courſe of theſe proſperous affaires, hath for many yeares tryed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forces: From which enterpriſe being driuen, he hath betooke himſelfe to craftie ſubtiltyes, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine diſſentions: hauing gotten men, who affecting nouelty, vnder the pretence of Pietie, haue torne the bowels of their owne Country and Church. Pittifull was the ſight of your Pouinces: The enemy of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation did brandiſh amongſt you the fire brand of deadly diſſention: A tumultuous tragedy was acted on the Theatre of Belgia, your aduerſari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s beholding it with much pleaſure: Finally, wee ſaw your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth ſhaking, and your eſtate <hi>almoſt</hi> deſperate, had not God appearing, beyond all expectation, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away this imminent deſtruction by timely and ſeaſonable remedyes: vſing to that purpoſe, your Authoritie, Wiſedome, and prudent Conſtancie.
<pb facs="tcp:11390:4"/>With how great patience you haue endured theſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent wits, with how great vigilancy you haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented this <hi>ſpreading contagion,</hi> if no man ſhould ſpeake of it, yet the greatneſſe of the diſeaſe, and your eſtate reſtored againe to ſafety, would aboundantly witneſſe. In which enterpriſe, the vertue of the moſt famous Prince of ORENGE hath manifeſtly appeared, in whom wee haue a ſingular proofe what very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry can performe with greateſt fortitude; who hath added to ſo many warlike acts the praiſe of ciuill pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. By this deed (moſt Honourable Lords) yee haue obtayned more praiſe, by reſtoring, then by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the Common-wealth: For this inteſtine pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence hath in few yeares brought more dammage, then forraine warres were able to bring in many ages. Of which your vertue all the Orthodoxe Churches throughout Europe doe reape great fruit; becauſe the ſparkes of this flame did already flye to them; and the iudgements of many among forraine nations did wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer concerning theſe controuerſies. For in the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Prouidence</hi> and <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> that opinion is wont to be moſt acceptable among the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which doth meaſure the counſels of God by the counſels of men, and doth put vpon God humane affections.</p>
            <p>But among other things which were prudently and happily done by you, the conuocation of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node of <hi>Dordt</hi> hath obtained the chiefe place. Then which Synode for many ages paſt there hath beene none more famous, more holy, nor more profitable to the Church. Wherevnto that yee might call moſt choiſe men from diuers parts, yee ſpared neither coſt,
<pb facs="tcp:11390:5"/>nor labour; wherein all things were done ſo orderly and grauely, that it hath drawne the people into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and hath ſtayed thoſe that were ſtaggering, and hath ſo troubled headſtrong &amp; obſtinate perſons onely with the ſight thereof, that they which before did ſeeme to be deſirous of the conflict, and greedily to call for the encounter, haue by contrary practiſes, (whether feare ſtrooke them, or their conſcience af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted them) begun to ſhun the hearing of the cauſe, to hate the light, and to worke delayes. To ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a thing, both other Princes did exhort you, and eſpecially the moſt renowned Prince IAMES, <hi>King of great Brittaine,</hi> who hath alwayes beene moſt earneſt and forward to driue away the errours of all innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; who as he is rightly ſtiled the <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> ſo he hath his eyes vigilant on all ſides, careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watching leſt Chriſtian faith ſhould any where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any damage.</p>
            <p>And I who to ſo holy a worke could not bring my trauell, haue at leaſt brought my deſires. It cannot be expreſſed how earneſtly I deſired to be preſent at that reuerend Synode, to which the Churches of <hi>France</hi> appointed me, with ſome of my brethren. What were the impediments which hindred my determined iourney, I neede not rehearſe; yet being abſent, I performed what I could; For I ſent to the Synode my opinion of the fiue points of the Controuerſies which are hindred in <hi>Belgia,</hi> hauing ſtrengthned it with places &amp; proofes out of the holy Scripture. And when many men, and the ſame good men, and of great authoritie and wiſedome amongſt you, had exhorted me that I would write ſomewhat vpon theſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies,
<pb facs="tcp:11390:5"/>I not vnwillingly obeyed; which I haue done, not ſo much in hope of effecting what I would, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed to refuſe them, and deſirous of making triall: For I had rather that godly and learned men ſhould finde in me want of prudence, then accuſe me of negligence. Therefore I haue printed my Scheduls and papers, and haue reviewed thoſe things which I had meditated vpon theſe queſtions, which I haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a plaine and vntrimmed ſtile, that as it were in a leane ſpare body, the force of the truth might cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare. And I haue indeauoured to bring light to this darkeneſſe, in which the moſt quicke-ſighted doe often grope at the way.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, how dangerous a thing it is to vndergoe the hazard of ſo many iudgements; how many there that are ambitiouſly ſoure, and proudly diſdainfull; how few there are that take and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe things; how fewer that are taken by them; how hard it is to contend with wily and wittie men; who euen when they themſelues are caught, doe ſo ſpeake as if they had catched others; and who in a deſperate cauſe doe ſo carry themſelues, as if they were touched with commiſeration: who vndoe againe the things that haue beene begun by themſelues, and doe of purpoſe infold their meanings, fearing to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; like Lyzards, who out of the open field doe runne into buſhes. Nor am I ignorant how hard a thing it is for a man that is imployed, whoſe minde is troubled with other cares and buſineſſe, to write pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and exactly concerning thoſe things whereto the moſt free ſtudies are ſcarce ſufficient, nor men at greateſt leaſure,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11390:6"/>
            <p>But your humanitie and wiſedome hath moued and ſtirred me vp, to be bold to attempt it: For ye know, that in great and hard enterpriſes, the endeauour is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, euen when ſucceſſe is wanting. Nor haue I doubted to conſecrate theſe my labours to you, that the worke done for the defence of that cauſe, which ye happily maintaine, might manifeſt it ſelfe in your name: I ſhall ſeeme to my ſelfe not to haue loſt my labour, though I get no praiſe, if I obtaine pardon: Or if by my example, I ſhall ſtirre vp any to performe ſome thing more perfectly, whereby the truth may ſtand vnſhaken againſt theſe innouators, which doe naughtily abuſe their wits, and are of a wicked and vnhappy audacity.</p>
            <p>In the meane while, in your wiſedome you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue from what beginnings, to how great encreaſes this peſtilence hath come, and how vnder a ſhew of the liberty of propheſing, the raines are let looſe to wanton wits, which couer licentiouſneſſe vnder the name of liberty. For whileſt (as it were for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſhew of wit) men diſpute of thoſe foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faith, of which heretofore there was no ſtrife amongſt vs, the moſt holy and moſt certaine things began to be called into doubt, and their ſcholaſticall skirmiſhing, forthwith burſt out into a ſerious and earneſt fight. For when this liberty (as it falleth out) had paſſed from the Schooles into the holy Pulpets, and ſo into the Streetes, Tauernes, and Barbers-ſhops, the whole Country was changed into a certaine ſea, boyling with tumults: Whence hatred hath beene bred in the people, and pietie is turned into conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obedience towards Magiſtrates is more
<pb facs="tcp:11390:6"/>ſlack: to which euils, when the ambition of ſome men, affecting nouelties, had ioyned it ſelfe, which ſtirred vp this fire with winde and fuell laid to it, this flame in a ſhort time hath vnmeaſurably encreaſed: But by the goodneſſe of God, and by your authority and prudent vigilancy (moſt illuſtrious Lords) the flame of ſo great a fire is abated, liberty is recouered, the Common-wealth is ſetled, the Vniuerſitie purged, and truth, which in many places durſt ſcarce open the mouth, or elſe was diſturbed by contrary clamours, broke through the obſtacles, and (as it is in the ſtriking of flints) it ſhone more cleare by the very conflict; yea truely, by it there haue appeared no obſcure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes of pietie in the people; by it there is greater concourſe to heare the word of God, and greater at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. For God (ſuch is his goodneſſe) doth vſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelues to ſtir vp vertues which grow ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in idleneſſe; For zeale and pietre being prouoked doe encreaſe, euen as the fire of the Smiths furnace decaying, is ſet on fire by water poured on. Alſo they that haue learned by experience, what ſnares Sathan doth lay for them that are a ſleepe and vnwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, are ſtirred vp to keepe watch for the time to come.</p>
            <p>There yet remaine ſome reliques of this diſeaſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the malice of the Factions quite aſſwaged; but there is hope that the ſides of this wound will in a ſhort ſpace cloſe together againe, and mens mindes will be reconciled. So that it may be vnlawfull in your Vniuerſitie (from whence this contagion crept into the whole Country) hereafter to teach any doctrine differing from the truth, and to call into doubt thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:11390:7"/>things which are piouſly and prudently determined out of Gods word in your ſacred Synode; and that hereafter no man be admitted to the ſacred Miniſtery, whoſe faith is not tryed, and his conſent with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren knowne; and that the authority be reſtored to Synodes, and their vſe be made more frequent: that the euills that are breeding may be preuented at their beginnings, as when the ſtinging Scorpion is bruiſed preſently vpon the wound. Alſo it hath beene wiſely prouided by you that theſe things hereafter bee not publiſhed among the common ſort, that the people be not taught ſo much to diſpute, as to liue: and that they accuſtome themſelues to fight with their owne vices, and not with other mens opinions. For it is a moſt hard, and a very profitable combate which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry godly man maketh with himſelfe. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, when ſtrife is ſowne by ſtrife, and not the truth but the victory is ſought, firſt charity and then truth is loſt among the contenders.</p>
            <p>And eſpecially diligence is to be vſed, leſt peace and riches bring forgetfulneſſe of the Croſſe of Chriſt: and leſt the people vnmindfull of the benefits of God, ſhould at length draw vpon them his iudgements. There are not wanting examples of people to whom when religion had brought forth riches and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a while after the ſame riches and proſperity choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked religion, and with a ſhamefull parricide killed their Mother. So much the more care therefore is to be had, that the eares of your people may alwayes ring with thoſe inſtructions whereby the memory of the calamities driuen from them may be refreſhed, and their mindes might tremble with a godly feare,
<pb facs="tcp:11390:7"/>when they foro-ſee a farre off the dangers to come, and Satan lying in waite for them.</p>
            <p>To which thing it is no light inſtigation, that by theſe late tumults you haue tryed, that the peace of the common-wealth, doth conſiſt in the integrity of Religion, neither can the purity of true Religion (which is maintained by you) be violated, but that alſo the pillars on which your common-wealth ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and by which the authority of your ſupreame Magiſtracy is ſuſtained, will be ſhaken. For theſe two are ſo knit together by a mutuall bond, that the one cannot be ouerthrowne, but the other alſo muſt fall downe. Your authority was ſtrooke at through the ſide of Religion; and in the foundations of the Church the foundations of the common-wealth were vndermined. Your power therefore will be ſound and ſafe, when obedience due to princes, ſhall be thought to be a part of piety: and when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church ſhall traine vp, by the word of God, the people to performe obedience to you. And on the other ſide, the Church ſhall flouriſh when Princes ſhall be her nourcing fathers, and ſhall thinke themſelues to be ſet by God at the ſterne of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that God might raigne by them, and that Religion might grow vp, and might carefully be manured vnder the ſhadow of their ciuill power. This you doe (moſt Illuſtrious Lords) diligently and happily: It cannot be ſaid how much your people are indebted to you, and they will ſtill owe you more. Surely, all good men in the Chriſtian world, doe greet your ſo proſperous ſucceſſe, and doe admire at your wiſedome, and doe ſtriue in prayers with God, that
<pb facs="tcp:11390:8"/>he would preſerue you long to the Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; whom hee hath vſed to preſerue the Church and common-wealth: and that he would ſo gouerne you by his ſpirit, and defend you by his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence, that all your endeauours may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their wiſhed ends, and that yee may haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth happily gouerned, a State ſet in ſafety, domeſticall concord, aboundant riches, valiant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, frequent victories, a people obaying your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and who may doubt whether they ſhould call you Lords or Fathers.</p>

Hence Hereſies haue beene bred, whileſt men, violently carried with the itching of their owne wit, runne out beyond the bounds of Gods word. Hence haue proceeded thoſe troubles which Sathan hath ſtirred vp in this age (which is as fertill of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, as it is barren of piety:) hauing vſed therto men, who by their lewd wit and raſh preſumption, daring to call God to account, and to preſcribe lawes to him, haue greatly afflicted the moſt flouriſhing Churches of the low-Countries. Moſt ſafe therefore it is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God as our guide, to vnderſtand ſo much as hee hath made manifeſt to vs in his word, to command ſilence to our ſelues, where God himſelfe ſpeaketh not. But we muſt haue a very great care, leaſt we patronize and maintaine the wiſdome and prouidence of God, with the damage of his iuſtice: and againe, leſt while we defend his iuſtice, wee put out the eyes of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence. God is not to be thought vniuſt, if hee doe any thing that doth not euery way anſwere to the rules we haue conceiued in our owne mindes. Theſe two things are ſeriouſly to be auoided, as two fatall and dangerous rockes; and yet it is farre worſe to ſet on God the marke of iniuſtice, then to place limits to his prouidence. For with leſſe perill is God made a careleſſe ſpectator and beholder of ſinne, then if he be beleeued to be the author and incitor to ſinne. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any more capitall miſchiefe, then to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre on God the cauſe of mans wickedneſſe. For thus it comes to paſſ, that men hauing broken their bars, doe ſcot free commit all riot, as hauing God the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and author of their wickedneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:11390:11"/>
               <p>And yet to reſtraine curioſitie, and to ſtrike our mindes with a religious feare, the conſideration of our owne meaneneſſe being compared to the diuine maieſtie, is much profitable. For if any of vs ſhould cruſh to death an Ant with his foot, no man would lay to his charge an action of iniuſtice for it, although the Ant hath not offended him, although he hath not giuen life to the Ant, although he hath deſtroyed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others worke, which cannot be reſtored by man, and although betweene man and it, there is no infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, but a kinde of certaine and finite proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But man hath grieuouſly offended God, and yet God hath giuen life to man, and there is no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene God and man, but as infinite a diſtance, as betweene a finite and infinite thing. If therefore God ſhall cruſh thoſe ſinfull men, which he is able to ſaue; if patiently tolerating the veſſels of anger, he ſhall make them the matter of his glory, ſhall any man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with God, or thinke goodneſſe wanting in him, or accuſe his iuſtice?</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are ſome who being weary of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions which proceede from the doctrine of Prouidence and Predeſtination, doe thinke that it is moſt ſafe for the peace of the Church and quiet of conſcience, not to touch
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11390:12"/>theſe queſtions, nor to ſpeake any words of them to the people, to be ſuggeſted into them: ſeeing that by theſe ſpeeches ſcruples are faſtned in mens mindes, doubtings are bred, and the faith of the weake is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Let the people be taught, (ſay they,) not what God doth or decreeth, but what he would haue to be done by vs: let the doctrine of good Workes be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into their minds, and the ſecrets of Election and Reprobation left to God.</p>
               <p>Surely this ſpeech ſauoureth more of honeſty, then truth. For theſe men while they make ſhew of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of piety, and loue of concord; they doe ſecretly accuſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles of imprudency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, becauſe they ſo often beate vpon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Election, in the new Teſtament. And while they are held with a prepoſterous religion, they are the authors, that the Paſtours of the Church cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a portion from the word of God; neither doe they propound to the people the intire Doctrine of the Goſpell. And whileſt in a voluntary ignorance they affect the praiſe of modeſty, they require diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And what ſhall we ſay to this; that without this Doctrine, due honour cannot be giuen to God, nor our faith made ſtable? For by the Doctrine of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, that immeaſurable heape of the goodneſſe and loue of God towards vs, by which he loued vs and reſpected vs, before the foundations of the world were laid, doth enter into our mindes. Alſo whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer light or grace God doth meaſure to vs, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be a riuer flowing from that eternall loue. By this doctrine mans merits doe fall to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11390:12"/>ground; and the imaginary faculty of free-will in things pertaining to ſaluation, doth vaniſh away. The confidence of our ſaluation will alſo ſtagger, vnleſſe it be vpholden by the immutable decree of God, and not by mans free-will. This doctrine alſo is a great lightning of our ſorrowes, and mittigation of all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe: while we conſider that all things, euen thoſe that are moſt grieuous, turne to the good of them, who are called by the purpoſe of God. Neither is there any more forcible inſtigation to good workes, then the acknowledgement of that eternall loue, wherewith God, in Chriſt, hath loued vs before all worlds. Finally, by this doctrine we are taught to ſearch into our ſelues and to try our owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to finde in vs, and to ſtirre vp the teſtimonies of our election; knowing that our owne endeauour and care ought to further the election of God, and that by the way of hell, that is, by impenitency and vnbeliefe, it is impoſſible to come to heauen.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine therefore, the Scripture being our guide, may profitably be propounded, ſo we keepe mediocrity betweene affected ignorance, and raſh cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; and follow ſuch a moderation, that while we doe auoide things vnlawfull, we doe not abſtaine from thoſe that are lawfull.</p>
               <p>In this worke we haue to doe with men which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend both wayes, and doe runne vpon either extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: For if any one, <hi>Arminius</hi> doth breake into the ſecrets of God, and doth with a ſcrupulous curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity cut into peeces the decree of Election; and yet the ſame man doth extenuate the whole doctrine of Election, as a thing, which if it were not knowne;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11390:13"/>Gods loue by it would not be diminiſhed towards vs, nor any iniury done to his grace: <hi>They which denie this election</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>denie that which is true,</hi>

For it doth not ſeeme likely that God, from eternity, hath decreed, how many eares of Corne ſhall grow in the Neapolitan or any other field; or how many ſhreds hang on the torne beggars coate, or couering: Becauſe theſe things haue no reſpect of good or euill, neither doe they adde to the glory of God, or protection of the world:

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11390:13"/>to his glory, or to the protection of the vniuerſe. Surely God hath, from eternity, fore-knowne all things, euen thoſe that are leaſt: But hee hath onely pre-ordained and decreed thoſe things which haue in them ſome matter of good, and whereby the glory of God is made more illuſtrious, or the world more perfect.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. God is in no wiſe the author, or inſtigator of ſin. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45.8. For God is not onely iuſt, but alſo iuſtice it ſelfe: And it is as impoſſible that hee who is iuſtice it ſelfe ſhould ſinne, or be the author of ſinne, as that whiteneſſe ſhould blacke the wall, or heate make one cold. Neither doth God onely doe the thing that is iuſt, but therefore the thing is iuſt, becauſe God doeth it. And ſurely that idle deuiſe of ſome, is to be hiſſed out, who ſay, that God, though he doth enforce men to ſinne, yet himſelfe doth not ſin; becauſe there is no ſin where there is no law, and God is bound by no laws. I confeſſe indeed that God is obnoxious to no Law: And yet it is certaine, that hee can doe nothing that is contrary to his owne
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11390:14"/>Nature. God cannot lie, becauſe hee is truth it ſelfe. God cannot ſinne, becauſe he is perfect righteouſneſſe it ſelfe. Theſe ſpeeches, that ſinne is committed ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Gods procuring or furthering, are altogether to be rooted out of diuinity.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Man by his owne fault hath brought deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelfe, neither can the fall of man be imputed to God. <hi>Thy deſtruction, O Iſraell, is from thy ſelfe; but in mee is thy helpe. Hoſea</hi> 12.9.10. As in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Infant,</hi> the ſunne and man doe worke together; yet if a monſter be generated, it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the ſunne, but to man: For therefore is the monſter bred, becauſe through the defect of the organs, or the euill affection of the matter, the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall agent cauſe is withdrawne from the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med courſe. Euen ſo to humane actions, God and mans will doe concurre, yet if any euill bee in the action, it ought not to be aſcribed to God, but to the diſpoſition of mans will.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And yet the Scripture doth ſometimes vſe thoſe phraſes of ſpeech, which doe yeeld occaſion to the prophane, of imputing their ſinnes to God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed by his will and incitation. It is well knowne with how great wickedneſſe, the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> moued with enuy, ſold their brother <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> Of this fact <hi>Ioſeph</hi> himſelfe thus ſpeaketh. <hi>Geneſ.</hi>

Satan afflicted <hi>Iob,</hi> the Chaldees ſteale away his goods; what ſaith this ſeruant of God to theſe things? <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken away, Bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> In the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith thus: Againſt thy holy childe Ieſus, whom thou haſt annointed, both <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the Gentiles, and the people of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> are aſſembled together, to doe whatſoeuer thy hand and thy counſell haue determined before to bee done. Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> in his firſt chapter of the Epiſtle of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſpeaking of the people that were worſhippers of Idols, and were giuen ouer to all wickedneſſe, ſaith, that God gaue them vp to vile and wicked affections, that they might doe theſe enormious things. God himſelfe doth witneſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp; Rom.</hi> 9. That he hardned <hi>Pharaohs</hi> hart. Finally who doth not tremble at theſe words of God which are ſet downe in the ſixt

               <p>Leaſt any prophane perſon ſhould abuſe theſe things, to the vnlooſing of the claſpe of intemperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and leaſt any whoſe heart is hardned againſt the word of God, ſhould impute the hardneſſe of it to God, who cannot be reſiſted.

               <p n="7">VII. Before all other things wee admoniſh, that the middle way be kept betweene the two extreames. One whereof is, to make God the authour of ſinne; the other is to aſſigne any thing to be done, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnwilling, ignorant, or not regarding, as if ſitting in a watch-tower he did expect caſuall euents depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon chance, or vpon mans pleaſure. Let him runne into neither of theſe, who would acknowledge the prouidence of God without damage of his iuſtice, not fathering his ſinnes vpon him, and would not call in ignorance or neglect of things in God, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his iuſtice.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Firſt therefore, it muſt be graunted that ſinne is not committed without Gods permiſſion: Neither ought this word of <hi>permitting</hi> offend any one as if it derogated from the care and prouidence of God, ſeeing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe in the 14. chapter of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11390:15"/>the <hi>Acts</hi> doth vſe this word; where he ſaith to the men of <hi>Lycaonia, God in times paſt</hi>

                  <hi>ſuffered all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to walke in their owne wayes;</hi> therefore God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſinne. To permit ſinne is, not to hinder it when thou canſt: thence it comes to paſſe that there are ſo many meanes of permitting ſinne, as of hindring it. God doth hinder ſinne two manner of wayes; either by his Iuſtice, or by his Power. By his Iuſtice he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth ſinne, by commanding, by forbidding, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing, by threatning, and by promiſing. By his power he doth hinder it, when he doth take away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or remoue the occaſion of ſinning, or by the efficacy of his ſpirit, doth change and encline to piety our wils that are prone to ſin. The former is a morall impediment, the latter a naturall, or euen a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. According to theſe meanes of hindering ſinne, the meanes of permitting it are alſo diuers: For God doth permit ſinne either by vnlooſing the Law, and giuing liberty of ſinning; or by not drawing away the ability of ſinning, which might hinder men from ſinning in act. After the former manner God doth neuer permit ſinne: after the latter manner he doth permit it; which he doth in not hindring that man ſhould aſſay it; and in not giuing a certaine ſuccour and meaſure of his grace, which if it were preſent, the ſinne might be preuented.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. This permiſſion is a certaine act of the diuine will, ſeeing it is voluntary; for God doth nothing vnwitting or vnwilling: God therefore permits ſinne, becauſe he will permit it; neither had he permitted it, if it had not beene good that it ſhould be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for if there were not euill, it would not be known
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11390:16"/>what is good: euen as we ſhould not know what light were, vnleſſe there were a night; neither had his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice (whereby he puniſheth, nor his mercy whereby he pardoneth) beene made knowne, nor his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereby he can draw good out of euill; nor his infinite loue, whereby hee ſent his ſonne into the world that he might die for vs; not that God doth ſtand in neede of our wickedneſſe to illuſtrate his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but becauſe, otherwiſe, man could not come to that full felicity to which hee was created. For God cannot be perfectly knowne, and therefore not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly loued, ſo long as his iuſtice and mercy is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne: So that by the very fall of man, God hath framed to man, a ſtep to a more perfect condition; and although in the reſpect of many particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which periſh, it might haue beene wiſhed that man had not ſinned, yet in reſpect of the vniuerſall good, whereof regard is rather to be had, God ought not to haue vſed his power to haue hindred ſinne, that it might not haue beene committed.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Furthermore, although God doth permit the Diuels and men to ſinne, yet doth hee not ſo let looſe the reynes to them, but that they are held faſt bound by the bonds of his prouidence, and whileſt they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of the path of righteouſneſſe, they are yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the limits of his prouidence, that they ſhould not hurt them whom God loues: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though mans will hath corrupted it ſelfe; yet is not therefore the gouernment of God diminiſhed, to which the willes of men are ſubiect, how much ſoeuer they are aduerſe to his commandement, and driuen with the ſpirit of rebellion doe <hi>gnaſh their teeth</hi> againſt his gouernment.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:11390:16"/>
               <p n="11">XI. The principall faculties of the ſoule are two, the Vnderſtanding, and the Will; the one by which man knoweth, and the other by which hee moues himſelfe. By the vnderſtanding, we are learned or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, by the will, we are eyther good or euill. That which in the vnderſtanding is to affirme or deny, that in the will, is to deſire or to refuſe. God doth not put wicked deſires into the minde: but he doth often caſt darknes into the mind, and in his iuſt iudgement doth blinde the vnderſtanding, ſtriking the rebells with a giddineſſe, and making them drunke with the ſpirit of ſleepe; yea truely, no otherwiſe then the maſter doth iuſtly blow out his ſeruants candle, which by night he doth abuſe at dice: So God doth take away the light of his knowledge, when man doth abuſe it to the contempt of God, and to the liberty of ſinning. Howbeit, God hauing taken away this light, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring will doth ſtumble, and grieuouſly offend; but hardneſſe of heart doth, of it ſelfe, follow this blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde. For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ioyneth theſe together as hanging one vpon another. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.40. <hi>God hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts.</hi> By this meanes latter ſinnes, are made the puniſhment of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinnes; as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> teacheth at large in his fift booke againſt <hi>Iulian. Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>For by the very ſame thing, whereby man by his latter ſinnes is made more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, by the ſame he is alſo made more miſerable:</hi> Not that ſinne is ſent from God as a puniſhment, but becauſe God doth vſe for a puniſhment that ſinne which is not from him. And hence doth that doctrine of a bare and careleſſe permiſſion vaniſh; becauſe a iudge doth not puniſh by a careleſſe permiſſion; but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11390:17"/>by decreeing or iudging according to iuſtice.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The ſubminiſtration, and furniſhing of the outward meanes of ſaluation, ſuch as are the word and ſacraments doe alſo worke to this obduration, and hardneſſe of heart. For vnleſſe God moue the heart by the powerfull grace of his ſpirit, mans wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe is more ſtirred vp by thoſe outward helpes, and hauing caſt off this troubleſome yoake, he is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through by-waies, and doth violently throw down himſelfe with greater ruine: And then is fulfilled that which is ſaid in the 81. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> I gaue them vp to their owne hearts luſts, that they might walke in their owne counſells.

               <p n="15">XV. Furthermore, although God by his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, doth giue his influence into humane actions, ſuſtayning the agent, and directing the actions, ſetting bounds to them, ordering the euents, and drawing good out of euill; yet muſt it not therefore be thought that God doth inſtigate to euill actions, or to haue forced <hi>Eue</hi> to the eating of the forbidden tree. To the clearing of which aſſertion, we ſay that God doth not onely worke by the creature, but alſo worke with the creature; both God and the creature are concurrent cauſes to one <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to the bringing forth of one effect; and theſe two taken together, are the totall cauſe of any action: which creature, if it doth worke voluntary, may by his concurrence pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the action wherein there is the concurrence of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11390:18"/>God, and determinate it to euill: By this meanes the whole fault doth remaine with the creature. For God effectually infuſing into the creature, doth not take away from it <hi>the free contribution of its owne power.</hi> If man ſinneth any thing in an humane action, the concurrence of God is naturall, but the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the creature is morall: whatſoeuer was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall in the eating of the forbidden Apple was from God; whatſoeuer was morall and ſtraying from the path of iuſtice, was from man. As God doth giue to a lame liuing creature the power of going, yet is not his lameneſſe from God; ſo though God doth giue to man the faculty of willing, and doth ſuſtaine the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motion of the will, and the act of willing; yet if any euill come which doth defile that act, it muſt not be ſaid to be from God: Man is the effector of ſinne, God the permitter. That act in which there is deformity, is naturally good, in as much as it is from God: but morally euill, in as much as it is from man. The action in which the ſinne is, is one thing, the deformity of the action in which formally the ſinne is, is another thing. To the action it ſelfe God doth concurre with man, but not to the ſinne.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Neither is God to be blamed that he doth concurre with the creature, which hee knoweth will abuſe his concurrence and aſſiſtance to ſinning: For mans vice cannot ſtraighten the limits of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor diſſolue that eternall law, by which the whole frame of nature doth ſtand, nor pull away that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall neceſſity, whereby the creature cannot moue it ſelfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Neither will therefore the power of God be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in naturall things, or his influence ceaſe, becauſe in morall things, the will of man is diſobedient to the law of God: Yea, God cannot require obedience from the creature, vnleſſe he ſhould ſuſtaine it, and giue to it power of mouing it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. As the Sunne is not the cauſe of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, although darkeneſſe doth neceſſarily follow the abſence of it: So God ſeeing he is the moſt exact iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, is not the cauſe of ſinne, although inordinate affections, blindeneſſe of minde, &amp; the prauity of the will, doe neceſſarily follow the deniall of the grace of God.

Although wicked men doe worke freely, and of their owne motion are carried to ſinne, God not alluring nor forcing them: yet it is certaine, that the euents which doe follow thence are directed and gouerned by Gods prouidence. For as the downefall of the running water, inclining to the lower parts, may be turned, the channell being guided by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the conueyor: ſo although wicked men of their owne diſpoſition are prone to ſinne, yet by the prouidence of God and his ſecret counſell, they are inclined to commit this ſinne rather then that, that they may ſerue the execution of the iudgements of God, when he will vſe them either to puniſh any ones wickedneſſe, or to try the faith of the godly, or to ſtirre vp their ſloathfulneſſe. This ſimilitude <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>

               <p>As therefore Horſe-leaches applyed to the parts of a ſicke man, while they ſatisfie their owne gorge, doe performe the intent of the Phyſitian: ſo wicked men, whileſt they rage againſt good men, beſides their owne intention, they further the purpoſe of God: as <hi>Eſay</hi> teacheth in his tenth Chapter; where God ſaith that hee had decreed to vſe the King of <hi>Aſsiria</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the hypocriſie of Iſrael, but that this minde was not in the King, being led onely by ambition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of prey: Thus God vſed the wickedneſſe of the brethren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to keepe famine from his people: and the treaſon of <hi>Iudas,</hi> for the death of Chriſt, and by it, for our redemption; and the ambition of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar</hi> taxing the whole Empire, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Mary</hi> out of <hi>Galile</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that there ſhee might be deliuered, and ſo the propheſie of <hi>Michai</hi> be

But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the will is not taken for the faculty whereby
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:11390:20"/>wee will, but for the act of willing or deſiring: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken for the thing it ſelfe which wee will, after the ſame manner as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. <hi>That the will of God is our ſanctification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Will, in God, is not a rationall appetite; for God is not capable of any appetite, yea, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: But the will of God, is that act of willing, whereby hee doth eyther command, or appoint and decree.</p>
               <p n="3">III. For the will of God is two-fold, the one is his decree, the other is his commandement. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, belongeth to the prouidence of God, and the commandement of God, belongeth to his iuſtice: By his decree, hee doth appoint and diſpoſe the euents of things; by his commandement hee doth gouerne our actions. By the former will, God doth appoint what he will haue done; by the latter, what he would haue vs doe. To the former all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures obey, euen the Diuels themſelues; to the latter onely the faithfull, and yet not that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Theſe faithfull men are eſteemed iuſt, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they obey the decree of God, but becauſe they are obedient to his commandement. So the wicked ſonne, wiſhing the death of his ſicke father, doth ſinne againſt the will of God, although his wicked minde doth conſent with the decree of God: On the other ſide, the ſonne which doth pray to God for the health of his ſicke father, doth obey the will of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by the decree of God his death is certaine, and the deſire of the good ſonne, is contrary to the purpoſe of God. God forbids murther; and yet hee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11390:21"/>decreed that the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould kill Chriſt, by which fact they ſinned againſt God, howſoeuer they fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his decree. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Vorſtius</hi> himſelfe doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>That God would not haue had his people ſo ſoone ſent away by Pharaoh, viz.</hi> becauſe God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed not to bend the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to obedience: But as concerning the commandement, it is no doubt but God commanded <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that hee ſhould ſend away the people without delay; for therefore God inflicted vpon him ſo many ſcourges; becauſe he did not obey the commandement of God. Neither by this will <hi>Vorſtius</hi> make God guilty of Hypocriſie, or fraudulent diſſimulation; as he doth falſely lay to our charge.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Theſe two willes, the Scripture doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mixe, and take them promiſcuouſly one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. So when Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. ſaith, that he <hi>deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Heauen, that hee might not doe his owne will, but the will of him that ſent him;</hi> it is certaine that Chriſt vnderſtandeth both theſe two willes, becauſe Chriſt by thoſe actions did both fulfill all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and alſo did execute the decree of God: And therefore eyther of theſe willes is called the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 46.10, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.27.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. This decree of God, is properly, and by it ſelfe, called the will of God; the law of God is not ſo properly called his will, for the law is rather a document or leſſon, then his will, and rather a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherein God doth make knowne to man, by what meanes he may be pleaſed, then what hee hath abſolutely appointed to come to paſſe. For onely of the will of God, ſo properly called, is that true
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11390:21"/>which is ſaide, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 115. <hi>God doth whatſoeuer hee will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. The promiſes and threatnings of God, are yet more improperly called the will of God, ſeeing by them God doth neither command, nor decree any thing abſolutely; but they are declarations, whereby God doth declare what ſhall come to paſſe; if man obey the law, or if he doe not obey it; if man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Goſpell, or if he doe not beleeue it.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the promiſes and threatnings of God,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                  </label> are his conditionall decree, and depending vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the condition by the pleaſure of man. But this cannot truely be ſaid: For if it ſhould be ſo,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> this decree would not be certaine by the will of God, although the euent was certainely foreſeene by him: Alſo nothing can be imagined more abſurd, then to appoint God to decree any thing with a condition, which condition, in the very moment in which hee decrees it, he knoweth will neuer be fulfilled. When a maſter ſaith to a ſeruant, if you will doe thus, you ſhall haue this reward, he doth declare, that hee will then giue the reward, when the condition is fulfilled. But God willeth nothing, which hee willed not from eternity. Indeede God doth promiſe life vnder the condition of obedience, but hee doth decree nothing vnder that doubtfull condition. Hee doth not elect <hi>Peter</hi> if hee ſhall beleeue, but hee electeth him to faith, that he might be ſaued: Neither was he onely willing to preſerue the Niniuites if they would be turned, but hee alſo gaue them repentance whereby they turned.</p>

Surely if God ſhould driue a man to doe thoſe things which hee hath forbidden to be done, or ſhould keepe backe him, who is indeauouring to obey the Law, with an oppoſite barre from his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; God ſhould will things that are contrary, and ſhould reſiſt his owne will: But his decree doth not reſiſt his commandement, when he doth require thoſe things from man, which doe exceede mans
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11390:22"/>power, and doth not miniſter to man that ability whereby he may fulfill what is commanded; for man himſelfe is the cauſe of his owne impotency and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, neither is God bound to giue thoſe powers to man, which he loſt by his owne fault. He which is in debt, doth not owe the leſſe becauſe hee hath conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his eſtate; neither doth that creditor deale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly which requireth his debt of the Bankerupt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not conſider him as a poore man, but as a debtor. <hi>Arminius</hi> therefore is deceiued, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning thus againſt <hi>Perkins.

Nor is that any better which he doth adde. <hi>As it cannot bee ſaide</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that God is willing that creature ſhould liue, to whom hee doth deny the act of his preſeruation: So alſo it cannot be ſaide, that God is willing that that action ſhould he performed by any one, to whom hee doth deny his concurrence and helpe, neceſſary for the performing of that action.</hi> Theſe things, and other ſuch like, doth hee ill beate vpon, for hee doth vſe a ſimilitude, which is a plaine diſſimilitude, for no man is bound to his <hi>Eſſe,</hi> to his being, neither can God exact from him, that is not, that hee ſhould be: But to obey God, man is naturally bound; Therefore God can rightly require of man what hee oweth, and yet is not therefore bound to giue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of obeying and fulfilling what hee commands; for God is not bound to reſtore to man, that power
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11390:23"/>which was once giuen and is now loſt by the fault of man. But here I would vſe the fitteſt words, and I had rather ſay, that God decreed not to giue grace to one, whereby he ſhould be conuerted and ſhould beleeue, then to ſay, that God decreed that the man ſhould be an vnbeleeuer and impenitent: For the word <hi>decreeing,</hi> is more fit to note out thoſe things which God determined to doe, then thoſe things which he determined not to cure.</p>

               <p n="1">I. The Antecedent will of God, hee ſaith is that, <hi>whereby God doth will any thing to the reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before all the actions of it, or before any act of that creature;</hi> but the conſequent is that, <hi>whereby he doth will any thing to the reaſonable creature, after any one act, or after many acts, of the creature.</hi> To the explication of which diſtinction, he bringeth theſe examples. God (ſaith he) by his Antecedent will, would ſtabliſh and confirme for euer the kingdome of <hi>Saul;</hi> by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent will, he would put him from his kingdome, and ſubſtitute in his place a man better then <hi>he.</hi> Chriſt by his Antecedent will, would gather the Iewes as a Henne gathereth her Chickens; but by his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will, hee would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11390:24"/>his Conſequent will, he was caſt out. By his Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will, the talents are giuen; by his Conſequent will, the talent is taken from the ſeruant.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The one of theſe willes is called the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will, the other is called the Conſequent; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that will goeth before this, for in this ſenſe, this diſtinction may be admitted, becauſe there is a certaine order among the purpoſes of God: Thus his will of creating man, was in order before his will of feeding or cloathing him: But with <hi>Damaſcen</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> it is called the Anrecedent will of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it goeth before the act of mans will; and they call that the conſequent will of God, which is after the will of man, and doth depend vpon it. This <hi>Arminius</hi> doth cleerely teach in his definitions before laide downe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Betweene theſe two willes of God hee puts this difference, that the Antecedent will of God, may be reſiſted, the conſequent cannot. Hee would haue it, that God ſhould be diſappointed in his antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will, and faile of his propounded end; But the conſequent will of God cannot he fruſtrated, but it muſt neceſſarily be fulfilled: for hee thinks that God doth not alwaies attaine to that which hee intends, and that ſometimes hee is diſappointed of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular end which he propounds to himſelfe; and that God is prepared to doe that which from eternity he knoweth he ſhall not doe; whence it comes to paſſe, that he hath prepared himſelfe in vaine, and that by his conſequent will, which is eternall, certaine, and immutable, hee hath decreed to harden thoſe repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, which by his antecedent will he is prepared to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11390:24"/>mollifie and conuert: And ſo he is prepared to doe, that which he hath decreed not to doe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Betweene theſe two wils of God (if any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit may be giuen to <hi>Arminius,</hi>) doth mans will come in, which doth cauſe, that God doth reuoke his ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent will, which is farre the beſt; and being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from his propounded end, doth turne himſelfe to another thing, then that which at the firſt he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: ſo farre, that <hi>Vorſtius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Diſput. de Deo. p.</hi> 65. <hi>that God afterward will not doe ſome things, which before he had promiſed, yea ſworne that he would doe.</hi>

If any Doctrine be contumelious againſt God, this is, accuſing him of folly, putting vpon him hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine affections, and falſely attributing to him wiſhes of no ſtrength, and a deſire of no force: as if they ſhould bring in God ſpeaking thus: I doe indeed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire to ſaue you, but ye hinder, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe what I deſire; I would if you would: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing by you I am fruſtrated of my intent, I will change my purpoſe of ſauing you, and my will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe bent, I haue determined to deſtroy you for euer. It is certainely plaine, that this Antecedent will of God, is not a will; but a deſire and wiſh, which God doth obtaine onely by entreaty, and as much as he may, by mans good pleaſure.

               <p n="6">VI. Furthermore, how grieuous a thing it is to be defrauded of ones deſire and naturall affection, and how diſagreeing this is to God, who doth not ſee, vnleſſe it be he that will willingly be deceiued? For if God be moſt perfectly good, yea goodneſſe it ſelfe, it muſt needes be, that his affections and naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires (if he haue any) are of higheſt ſanctity, iuſtice, and perfection: and therefore nothing is ſo much to be wiſhed, as that that naturall affection might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and that God might obtaine his deſired end.

                  <hi>that ſomething doth happen vnexpected to God, and which is bitter and very diſtaſtfull to him, and doth</hi> (although it be vnproperly ſpoken) <hi>bring very great griefe to him, and which doth proceede, not from his Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, but from his Conſequent will, hauing tryed all things in vaine;</hi> Which ſpeach, doth doubtleſſe abaſe God below the ſtate of man: For if any ſuch thing ſhould happen, euen amongſt men, and any ones endeauour, hauing tryed all things in vaine, ſhould be deluded, it would be an argument, either of imprudency, or weakeneſſe, or infidelity. There is cauſe therefore we ſhould lament the ſtate of God, who vſing an vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous ſucceſſe, hath ſo ill performed the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It is alſo abſurd, yea impious to affirme,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:11390:25"/>that God, to whom all things from eternity are not onely foreſeene, but alſo prouided for; ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any thing that from eternity hee knew would not come to paſſe, and to haue propounded an end to himſelfe, to which he knew he ſhould not attaine; as if one ſhould leuell at a marke which is not, nor euer will be: For if God from eternity knoweth that this man ſhall be damned, in vaine doth hee wiſh from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, that he ſhould be ſaued: and hee doth from eternity know that he ſhall not be partaker of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall deſire, and his antecedent will.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. What a thing is it, that hereby there is brought in reſiſtance betweene theſe two wils of God, the latter of which doth correct the former? for by this Antecedent will, God doth deſire to doe that, which from eternity he is certaine hee ſhall not doe. And God is imagined doing ſomething hardly and vnwillingly, and againſt that end which hee had firſt intended, becauſe mans will comes betweene, by which it comes to paſſe, that God doth ceaſe from that end propounded to himſelfe, which was farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if <hi>per</hi>

                  </gap>, vpon a ſecond aduiſe, he ſhould obtaine ſome ſecondary good. <hi>Arminius</hi> doth not diſſemble this, whoſe words are theſe:
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>God doth ſeriouſly deſire all men ſhould be ſaued, but being compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſtubborne and incorrigible malice of ſome men he will haue them make loſſe of their ſaluation.</hi> But God doth nothing vnwillingly, neither can he be compelled by man, to the changing of his will.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And if theſe weake affections and ineffectuall deſires, of which he is diſappointed, by the ſtepping betweene of mans will, be attributed to God, there is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11390:26"/>no doubt, but that God created man floting betweene his Antecedent and Conſequent will; as not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out griefe fore-ſeeing the fall of man, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee created a creature which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely periſh, and yet hee would not abſtaine from his creation, becauſe his decree of creating man could not be aboliſhed: ſo that God bound himſelfe in thoſe ſtraights, out of which hee could not quit himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="10">X. It is not alſo to be indured, that the will of God ſhould remaine vncertaine, vntill the condition, vnder which God doth Antecedently will any thing, be either fulfilled or broken. For although the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection of God towards all men, be not made to depend on mans will, yet (according to <hi>Arminius</hi>) the effect thereof is vncertaine, vntill God by his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will hath decreed to ſaue this or that man. But <hi>Arminius</hi> makes this Conſequent will in God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on mans free-will, and doth make it to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faith, and the right vſe of grace: Therefore <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius,</hi>

               <p n="11">XI. But although all the counſels of God are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and immutable, neither can God be ſaid to will any thing anew, which he hath not willed from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; yet whoſoeuer ſhall exactly conſider this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent will of God ſhall finde that it is made to come after his Antecedent will, not onely in order, but in time: For it is impoſſible that God ſhould at one time deſire to ſaue all men, and to damne ſome. And it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11390:26"/>muſt needes be, that the Antecedent will of God muſt ceaſe, as blotted and raced out by his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, before there can be place for his Conſequent will.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. And when the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <hi>that the will of God cannot be reſiſted;</hi> by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, there is made a will of God which may be reſiſted, and the execution whereof may be hindred by man.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. And here, if any where, we may ſee how little conſtant the <hi>Arminians</hi> are. For they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that in the ninth Chapter to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> it is ſpoken of the Antecedent will of God, by which God will haue mercy vpon ſome, (for ſo they ſpeake) that is, vpon ſuch as beleeue, and not of his Conſequent will, by which he hath determined preciſely and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to haue mercy on this or that man: And yet they forgetting themſelues, ſay, that this Antecedent will may be reſiſted; when notwithſtanding Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the ſame place. <hi>Who can reſiſt his will?</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore let <hi>Arminius</hi> deny, that the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will of God is a will, but rather call it a wiſh, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or affection; or if he doth contend that it is a will, let him confeſſe that it cannot be reſiſted.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>litudes. <hi>Arminius</hi> vſeth examples of men which cannot be made partakers of their vowes, but by meanes that are not conuenient; and of them who are oftentimes diſappointed of their intention. But to God there are neuer wanting iuſt and conuenient meanes, by which he ſhould obtaine that which he intends; neither can he be diſappointed of his intent. But you ſay, if God ſhould exerciſe his omnipotency, in conuerting man, he ſhould force mans free-will, and compell mans vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary liberty. But that I deny: For he can without conſtraint ſo bend the will, that it ſhould follow of its owne accord. Without conſtraint hee ſuddenly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11390:27"/>changed the minde of <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 33. and the minde of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.23. and the minde of the <hi>Aegyptians, Pſal.</hi> 105.25. and of <hi>Kings, Pro.</hi> 21.1. If God doth make this change of the will in wicked men, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mans free-will vntouched; how much more may hee doe it in good and faithfull men? God without conſtraint did change the heart of the <hi>Theefe</hi> on the Croſſe, and ſo doth he of all, from whom hee takes their ſtony heart, and giues them an heart of fleſh, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.26. and of thoſe, who when they were dead in ſinne, hee raiſed vp with a ſpirituall reſurrection, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. We ſhall ſee <hi>Arminius</hi> is of opinion, that the vnderſtanding is vnreſiſtably indued with light by God, and that God doth vnreſiſtably giue power of beleeuing the Goſpell to all men, to whom the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhall be preached, and that hee drawes their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: But when the minde hath fully receiued in this perſwaſion, and the affections doe ſtir vp the will, it is impoſſible but their will ſhould moue it ſelfe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the minde, inſtructed by God, doth appoint it, and whether the appetite doth force it; for theſe are the onely incitements of the will, neither is it moued by any other impulſion. The ſchoole and followers of <hi>Arminius,</hi> are alſo of opinion, that the Elect are drawne of God by effectuall and powerfull grace, the effect whereof is moſt ſure, becauſe God doth draw them in a congruent and fit time and manner, in which he knoweth they will infallibly follow him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them: And yet the <hi>Arminians</hi> meane not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that any force is offred to the will of man, but that it is ſo vehemently affected with a morall and ſweet perſwaſion, that it followeth of its owne accord. The
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11390:28"/>example of the Theefe, doth ſeeme to mee to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table aboue all the other; whoſe heart ſo ſuddendly changed in a time of aduerſity, when the faith of the Apoſtles themſelues did ſhake, is an euident leſſon, how great the efficacie of the holy Spirit is on them who are called by the purpoſe of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. But of this efficacy of calling, it ſhall be ſpoken more at large in his proper place.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Hence appeares with how prepoſtrous dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence <hi>Arminius</hi> hath turned his wit to the defence of free-will. For there lay open to him a moſt ſure and plaine way, whereby God might ſhew forth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the conuerſion of man, without the diminiſhing of our liberty. Nor, while hee doth patronize and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend free will, ought he to ſtrike againſt the wiſedome and perfection of God, whom hee would fruſtrate and diſappoint of his owne end and naturall deſire, and wiſh thoſe things which he knowes hee ſhall not obtaine, and propound an end to himſelfe which ſhall neuer be.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. In the meane while, the prudent reader ſhall eaſily diſcerne whereto that ſimilitude of the marchant making loſſe, and caſting his wares into the ſea, with his owne hands, may belong. For <hi>Arminius</hi> doth not onely expreſſely ſay that God is <hi>compelled</hi> to doe ſomething which he had not intended, (for the marchant did not intend to doe this, but doth it <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11390:28"/>ſpoken by prudent men to the reproach of God, or by vnwiſe men through ignorance, it doth ſtrike hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into pious mindes.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. But in this diſtinction of the will of God, into Antecedent and Conſequent, the firſt whereof doth goe before, the other doth follow mans will; this is farre the worſt thing, that by it, the will of man is made to goe before the election of God: For according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> God by his antecedent will would ſaue all men, and giue them power of beleeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt; but by his conſequent will, doth elect or reprobate ſeuerall men, according as hee fore-knowes their faith, or infidelity. A deadly doctrine, by which the election of man doth depend vpon mans will, and our faith is made the cauſe, and not the fruite of our election, and man chooſeth God, and applyeth himſelfe to God, before he is choſen of God: Whence it comes to paſſe, that on the one ſide, mans pride is blowne vp, as it were, with bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and on the other ſide, faith is vndermined, as it were, with trenches, and confidence doth decay: For what certainty can there be of our ſaluation, if our election depend vpon ſo inſtable a thing. But of theſe things more at large in their proper place. Now thoſe examples with which <hi>Arminius</hi> doth ſupport that double will of God, are to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. God (ſaith he) by his antecedent will would ſtabliſh the throne of <hi>Saule</hi> for euer; but by his conſequent will, he would ouerthrow it, as it is 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 13 13. but there is no ſuch thing to be found; for <hi>Samuell</hi> doth not ſay, that God would ſtabliſh the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11390:29"/>kingdome of <hi>Saule;</hi> but he ſaith, <hi>God had eſtabliſhed thy kingdome for euer;</hi> betweene which there is a great deale of difference: If God had eſtabliſhed it, it had beene his will to ſtabliſh it: But becauſe hee did not eſtabliſh it; it is certaine it was not his will to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. There is no more force at all in the other example. Chriſt (ſaith hee) by his antecedent will, would gather the Iewes, as a Hen gathereth her chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens; but by his conſequent will, hee would ſcatter them through all nations. <hi>Math.</hi> 22.37. But this place ſignifieth quite another thing. Chriſt ſpeakes to <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and ſaith, that hee would haue gathered his children together; but <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> her ſelfe reſiſted, with all her power. <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is one thing, and her children another, who here are expreſly diſtinguiſhed from the citty: By <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> vnderſtand the Prieſts, the Leuites, the Scribes, and the prince of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for theſe did moſt of all withſtand Chriſt: By the children of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> underſtand the people. Chriſt ſaith, that hee would haue gathered together theſe children; neither is it to be doubted, but that he gathered together many of them, although the rulers were vnwilling. This place, therefore, maketh nothing for that Antecedent will, which theſe men would haue not to be fulfilled, when indeede it was fulfilled as much as ſeemed good to God. Then alſo theſe words, <hi>how often would I,</hi> they miſvnderſtand them of the Antecedent will, which is the decree of God; when <hi>to will,</hi> is here nothing elſe, then to inuite and command: So Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> thinkes, <hi>Encherid.

               <p n="20">XX. The other examples are vnworthy that we ſhould ſtay long vpon them. By his Antecedent will. (ſaith he) thoſe were called to the wedding, which by his Conſequent will were declared vnworthy: By his Antecedent will, hee without the wedding garment is inuited; by his Conſequent will, hee is caſt out. By his Antecedent will, the Goſpell is offered to the Iewes; by his Conſequent will, it is taken away. In all theſe things, that will of God, whereby men are called, is no other thing, then to command, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite, not to decree that by his Antecedent will, which afterward hee hath broken off by his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. Neither are wee ſcrupulouſly to enquire why God hath called them, whom hee knoweth will not follow. The end why God doth this, is euident, to wit, to require of men, that which they owe. To ſearch any farther into the intent of God, is to make God obnoxious to accounts, and to breake into his ſecrets.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. It is not to be ouerpaſſed, that <hi>Arminius</hi> will haue God, equally deſire to ſaue all men by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent will, but when he is prepared to the effect, &amp; execution of that will, he doth thoſe things which are contrary to that will. For hee preacheth the Goſpell to thoſe that are very wicked, as to the men of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum; he doth deny that fauour to thoſe that are leſſe wicked, as to the men of <hi>Tyrus</hi> &amp; <hi>Sydon;</hi> and he doth ſuffer many wilde people and ſtupid, with their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:11390:30"/>barbarous cruelty, to be ouerwhelmed in darkeneſſe. But why ſo? <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>their Anceſtors refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Goſpell.</hi> O ridiculous reaſon! Should hee that doth equally deſire the ſaluation of all, be hindred with ſo light an impediment, and which is contrary to his iuſtice, as ſhall afterward be taught? Thus though <hi>Arminius</hi> doth teach, that God would by his Antecedent will ſaue all ſeuerall men; it is yet mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by experience, that God through many ages hath denyed, and doth yet deny, to moſt nations, thoſe meanes without which they cannot be ſaued, and doth onely ſupply thoſe meanes, which meanes alone, none euer vſed well.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. But God (ſaith he) ſeeing hee is very good by nature, cannot but wiſh well to all men by his Antecedent and primary will; as being created af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own image. Theſe things were ſpoken by them rightly, &amp; agreeably to the nature of God, if we were borne without originall ſinne: But ſeeing the image of God is almoſt blotted out, and in place of it, the image of the Diuell hath ſucceeded, no reaſon doth compell vs to beleeue that God is willing to ſaue all and ſingular men; but the holy Scripture doth teach, that ſome are ſaued by the meere grace of God, and by election, according to his purpoſe, the reſt being left in their naturall perdition, and appointed to damnation for thoſe ſinnes which they were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of their owne accord.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. All theſe things are not therefore ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that we ſhould reiect this diſtinction of the wil of God, into his Antecedent and Conſequent will: For we know, that among the decrees of God, ſome are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:11390:30"/>before, and ſome are after in order. But wee denie that there are two decrees of God, betweene which mans will ſteppeth in; as if mans will came betweene the decree of creating man, and the decree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning certaine men. But we denie that the will of man doth ſo come betweene the two decrees of God, that the firſt, or Antecedent decree is broken off by the will of man, and that God is compelled to abſiſt from that end which he had propounded to himſelfe, and which he did ſeriouſly intend: We deny alſo, in the worke of our election, the preciſe will of God to depend on the fore-ſeeing of any power or action of mans free-will; or the Conſequent will of God to be ſuſpended on mans will: Concerning which thing, it ſhall be diligently ſpoken in the proper place.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:11390:31"/>be true, it muſt needes be, that God put in man that inclination to ſinne; which ſeeing it is an euill thing, God ſhould be made the author of that which is euill, and to haue inclined man to ſinne; which cannot be ſpoken without hainous wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It was the leaſt finne which <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned in, gluttony, but that was farre the greateſt, that he had rather beleeue the Serpent then God, and that being ſpurred on by ambition, he would be like God in the knowledge of good and euill: And that while hee obeyed the Serpent, hee gaue credit to reproaches caſt vpon God. Finally becauſe he preferred ſo ſmall a thing before the commandement of God, therefore the leſſer the eating of the Apple was, the greater was his ſinne.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This ruine beganne at the vnderſtanding, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which Sathan had ſpread the cloud of falſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had caſt the imagination of a falſe good. To whoſe perſwaſion, when man ſhewed himſelfe ready, then peruerſeneſſe of the will, and inclination of the appetites to ſinne, followed this darkening of the minde.</p>
               <p n="5">V. This fall happened, God indeede not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, but yet permitting it. There was not wanting power to his omnipotency, by which hee was able to hinder this fall, neither did enuy turne away his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: God therefore permitted it, becauſe he would permit it, and becauſe it was good that he ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it He that is the chiefeſt good, would not haue permitted euill, vnleſſe it had beene good that euill ſhould haue entred into the world; by that permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he made a way for the manifeſtation of his glory
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11390:31"/>and opened a way, to man himſelfe, to a ſtate farre more excellent: For without ſinne, the mercy of God, whereby he pardoneth, and his iuſtice whereby he puniſheth, had neither of them been made knowne, nor had hee made knowne his infinite loue to the church, by the ſending of Chriſt into the world, to aboliſh our ſinnes, and to carry vs to a celeſtiall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Neither doe I ſay theſe things, as if I thought that God doth ſtand in neede of our wickedneſſe, to the manifeſtation of his glory; but I ſay, that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, that hee might come to greater perfection then that was, in which hee was created. And hee could not come to that perfection, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods iuſtice and mercy, which doth ſhine forth out of this fall, and out of the remedy which he had prepared for this fall: To which purpoſe, the words of Saint <hi>Auſten,</hi> in his booke <hi>de Correp. &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti. Cap.</hi> 10. are very proper. <hi>He that created all things very good, and fore-knew that euill things would riſe out of thoſe good things, knew that it did more pertaine to his omnipotent goodneſſe, to make good things, euen out of euill things, then not to ſuffer euill things to be.</hi> The like hee ſaith, <hi>Encherid. Chap.</hi> 96.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Arminians</hi> bring no other cauſe of this permiſſion, then this: Becauſe God would not force mans voluntary liberty, nor compell his will, neither did he thinke it conuenient to vſe his omnipotency, in a thing which belongs to mans free will: But they doe too negligently touch ſo great a matter, neither doe they ſufficiently weigh the moment of things, and the circumſtances of the fall of Adam. For God without the diminiſhing of mans liberty, could haue
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11390:32"/>reſtrained Sathan, and hindred him that hee ſhould not tempt man. He could haue forewarned man, that he ſhould not beleeue the Serpent. He was able not to haue propounded the tree to man, by the eating whereof he knew man would ſinne. Hee could haue giuen man more ſtrength, and more light, and more vnderſtanding. He could haue giuen extraordinary ſtrength in the very inſtant of temptation: And yet by theſe, force had not beene offered to mans will, nor his liberty violated. The Angels are examples hereof, whom he doth confirme in good, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſtraint: By theſe it is manifeſt that the fall of man happened, God not compelling, but yet diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, and by his prouidence turning that euent which hee fore-knew from eternity, to an end which hee had determined with himſelfe from eternity.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Neither is it to be ſaid, that God withdrew his grace from man; for this were to compell him, as the houſe doth neceſſarily fall, when the pillars are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; nor that God tooke from him the liberty of his will, for ſo he had brought a neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but he would not hinder that man ſhould not be tempted by Sathan, nor would he helpe him with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſuccour. And whereas man ſinned freely, yet that fell out, which God from eternity fore-knew would bee, and the creatures themſelues, before the creation of man, did teſtifie that it would come to paſſe: For before <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, God had put into the Plants healthfull powers to keepe away diſeaſes; already had he cloathed the ſheepe with fleeces, and had formed cattell for the vſe of man, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes of humaine infirmity, and had beene in vaine
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:11390:32"/>created, if man had ſtood in his integrity.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Now whether the digeſtion and egeſtion of meate, to be refreſhed with ſleepe after labour, to enioy the marriage bed, to grow in ſtature, to haue fleſh that may be wounded and burnt (to all which man before his fall was obnoxious,) whether I ſay, theſe are ſuch things as may perpetually agree to a creature perfectly bleſſed, or whether they doe not ſecretly teſtifie what ſhould be the condition of man to come, I leaue it to be iudged of by wiſe men.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And yet it is no doubt, but that <hi>Adam,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any extraordinary helpe, had ſtrength to reſiſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: For it is not credible, that God gaue a Law to man, when he was made at firſt, to the performing of which he did not giue power: yet in reſpect of the fore-knowledge of God, the fall of man was certaine. For the act of the will may be certaine and defined before God; the liberty of mans will being vntouched and intire: So it is no doubt, but the tortours had power and ability of breaking the bones of Chriſt, when yet in reſpect of the fore-knowledge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, it was impoſſible that they ſhould be broken. The will of man may by a certaine and voluntary motion, determine it ſelfe to ſome one thing, and yet doe that which, either the knowledge of God hath certainely fore-knowne, or his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath certainely fore-ordained.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Theſe things are firmely to be held, leaſt the fault of man be transferred vpon God. For howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God doth draw good out of the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet he neuer doth doe euill, that good may come of it:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11390:33"/>Neither muſt we think that God would force man to ſinne, although his glory ſhould manifeſt y appeare thereby. Gods glory muſt not be further. I with the damage of his iuſtice; but after a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Man did not ſinne that Chriſt ſhould aboliſh ſinne; but Chriſt came that he might aboliſh ſinne.</p>
               <p>Here is nothing ſaid, that ought to trouble tender eares, or which ſhould make God partaker of ſinne: which yet if any one doth either not conceiue, or not digeſt, it is better to accuſe his owne dulneſſe, then accuſe the iuſtice of God, and to abſtaine from lawfull things, then attempt vnlawfull things.</p>

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> indeede, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. ſaith, <hi>that all men ſinned in</hi> Adam; neither is it any doubt but that Chriſt was in <hi>Adam,</hi> as being one of his poſterity; but that ſentence of the Apoſtle doth not concerne Chriſt, becauſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt was not in <hi>Adam,</hi> but onely his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature: neither is he from <hi>Adam,</hi> as from the agent principle, and from the ſeminating power, but thence he tooke that matter, which by the ouer-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of the holy Ghoſt, was freed from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon contagion.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Now if you ſhould aske me, whether Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne is done away by Baptiſme, or whether that blot doth yet remaine in thoſe that are regenerated by the holy Ghoſt; it is readily anſwered out of the Scripture, and experience, which is ſo certaine here, that there is no place left for doubting. <hi>Dauid</hi> was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11390:35"/>circumciſed, and plentifully inſtructed with the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, and yet he doth confeſſe, that he was not free from this ſtaine, but was polluted in an equall contagion with others. And Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. ſpeaking (vnder his owne perſon) of euery man, in whoſe minde the law of God is faithfully imprinted, doth acknowledge that ſinne doth dwell in him, which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aileth <hi>the law of ſinne,</hi> becauſe it doth ſtirre him vp to ſinne. We ſee infants dye as ſoone as they are baptiſed; and <hi>death,</hi> the Apoſtle being witneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>is the wages of ſinne.</hi> I demand, for what ſinne doe thoſe Baptiſed infants dye? is it for actuall ſinne? but they haue committed none: therefore it is for Originall ſinne. Whence it appeareth, that Originall ſinne doth remaine after Baptiſme, wherein ſinne is remitted, as touching the guilt, although it remaine in the act, as Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> teacheth at large in his firſt Booke againſt <hi>Iulian,</hi> concerning Marriage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, <hi>Cap.</hi> 25. and 26. <hi>The concupiſcence of the fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is forgiuen in Baptiſme, not that it ſhould not be at all, but that it ſhould not be imputed for ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. But ſeeing the regenerate doe afterward ſinne, whence are theſe ſinnes, but from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corruption? For that being taken away, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects alſo, which doe flow onely from this cauſe, would be taken away.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And what ſhall we ſay to this, that the beſt men beget their children tainted with this blot, and therefore ſtanding in neede of Baptiſme? Now if the parents begetting children, were without originall ſinne, how could they ſend this blemiſh to their iſſue,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11390:35"/>and giue that to their children, which themſelues haue not?</p>
               <p n="10">X. Therefore, ſay you, marriage is euill, ſeeing by it children of wrath are begotten, and ſinne is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, which ought rather to be pulled vp by the roote, and to be choaked in the very ſeede. I anſwere, that marriage is more ancient then ſinne, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God himſelfe; the ſinne that came vpon it, doth not hinder, but that marriage is naturally a good thing: No otherwiſe then meate and drinke, are things that are good, and to be deſired, although thereby the life of wicked men is ſuſtained. Beſides, marriage doth bring forth ſonnes to God, and doth ſerue to fill vp the number of the Elect. I let paſſe, that the faithfull couple doe ioyne their prayers, doe ſtirre vp one another to good workes, doe cure one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers incontinency, and in ſlippery places doe ſtretch forth the hand one to another. Neither are there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting examples of wicked men, to whom, by Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit there haue happened good and godly children; euen as God doth ſend ſeaſonable raine on thoſe ſeeds which were ſtollen and ſowed by a theefe.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Theſe two things, <hi>to wit,</hi> the priuation or want of originall righteouſneſſe, and the inclinableneſſe to euill, are in originall ſinne. For as ſickneſſe is not onely a priuation of health, but alſo an euill affection of the body from the diſtemper of the humours: ſo this hereditary blot, is not onely the want of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but alſo the inclinableneſſe to vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The laſt of theſe proceedes from the former. For the ſoule, which by originall ſinne hath ceaſed to be good, is neceſſarily euill; and the ſoule being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the will, which cannot be idle, holines and righteouſneſſe being loſt, muſt needes turne to the contrary part.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This corruption brings blindneſſe to the minde, peruerſeneſſe to the will, perturbation to the appetites, the loſſe of ſupernaturall gifts, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of thoſe that are naturall.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11390:36"/>who ſay that originall ſinne is concupiſcence, doe not attaine ſufficiently to the nature of concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence: For Originall ſinne doth infect all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the reaſonable ſoule, and concupiſcence is the diſeaſe of the will and appetite; alſo concupiſcence, is contrary to one commandement of the Law, and Originall ſinne, is contrary to the whole Law: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by it, doe men ſinne more againſt the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the law then againſt the firſt. What? that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence is forbidden by a proper law: But I know not whether Originall ſin may be ſaid to be forbidden by the law; for God doth not command, that wee ſhould be generated or begotten pure &amp; without ſin, for ſo God ſhould ſpeak to man before he were born. Surely man is not bound to obey the law, before he be man; and ſeeing the law doth not ſpeak, but to them that heare, &amp; are partakers of reaſon, to think that the law commands a man that is growne to age, to be born without ſin, is a ridiculous thing, &amp; well nigh a dreame: For ſo the law, ſhould command him to be born, that is already born, &amp; him to be begotten, that is already grown a man. The law doth not command, but preſuppoſe Originall righteouſnes &amp; doth ſpeake to man, being conſidered in the ſtate wherein he was before the fall, requiring that old debt and naturall obedience: Whence it is manifeſt, that Originall ſin, is condemned by the law, but not forbidden.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Of this ſinne, although the Scripture ſpeaketh ſo expreſſely, and ſenſe it ſelfe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth abundantly teſtifie it, yet there haue not beene wanting ſome who did deny this ſinne, and would not acknowledge mankinde from his firſt

               <p n="9">IX. In Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> age, <hi>Pelagius &amp; Celeſtius</hi> did deny Originall ſinne, and did contend, that ſinne did paſſe from fathers to their iſſue, onely by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and imitation: They did deny that ſinne was remitted to infants by Baptiſme, becauſe they had none; and did affirme, that by it onely, the kingdome of heauen was opened to them; whoſe hereſie is long agoe hiſſed out, and ſtrongly confuted by Saint <hi>Austin.</hi>

The reaſoning then of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, doth fall to the ground, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13.14, where ſpeaking of ſinne which hath flowed from <hi>Adam,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his poſterity, when he had ſaid, <hi>That ſinne was in the world vntill the Law,</hi> hee afterward proues it, by the death of the infants, who were dead before the daies of <hi>Moſes: Death</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>raigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>euen ouer them that had not ſinned after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of</hi> Adams <hi>tranſgreſsion,</hi> that is, ouer infants which had not ſinned actually: Hee thereby proueth, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11390:38"/>ſinne was in thoſe infants, becauſe death is the fruit and puniſhment of ſinne. Seeing therefore the death of infants is a puniſhment of Originall ſinne, if this Originall ſinne were not truely ſinne, but onely the puniſhment of ſinne, then this death of infants would be the puniſhment of a puniſhment, and not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinne; but to ſay that God doth puniſh puniſhments, and not ſinnes, is vncomely for any, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for thoſe who profeſſe themſelues to be maintainers of Gods iuſtice.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. And if the Originall blot of infants is not ſinne, but onely the puniſhment of ſinne, they are baptiſed in vaine: For, baptiſme is not profitable to waſh away puniſhments, but to waſh away ſinnes. In vain are they waſhed, that are without the filth of ſin. Why is it neceſſary men ſhould be borne againe; but becauſe they are dead in ſinne? Whence is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſenes, by which naturally men are prone to euill; but from vice? and what is this vice but ſinne?</p>
               <p n="15">XV. But (you ſay) it is not ſinne, vnleſſe it be voluntary. I confeſſe it, if you ſpeake of actuall ſinnes; but if you ſpeake of the naturall ſtaine and blot, it is not neceſſary, that this naturall blot be procured by euery ones owne will; it is enough if it be contrary to the Law: For this is the beſt difinition of ſinne, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> layeth downe, that <hi>ſinne is,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>the breach of the Law:</hi> And it cannot be doubted, but that that is contrary to the law, which doth ſtirre vp a man to rebell againſt the law. For although Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne hath not yet ſtirred vp the infant to ſinne in act, yet is it apt and prone to ſtirre him vp: No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then the Snake which hath not yet infected
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11390:38"/>any one with her poyſoning biting, hath yet an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted poyſon in her, and a naturall readineſſe to hurt. Originall ſinne alſo, may be ſaid to be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, becauſe by it we ſinne voluntarily, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore in him wee were deſirous of this corruption.

               <p n="16">XVI.

Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. ſpeaketh thus: <hi>If one dyed for all, all likewiſe were dead.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. doth affirme that we are dead and crucified with Chriſt.

               <p n="3">III. Reaſon it ſelfe doth conſent to this: for if <hi>Adam</hi> had receiued good things, not for himſelf alone, but for his poſterity; it is no maruell, if being ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of theſe good things, he loſt them for himſelfe and his poſterity.

Nor is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more equall, then that the ſonne ſhould pay his fathers debts, and that as they are heires of their eſtates, ſo they might be heires of their debts.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:11390:39"/>
               <p n="4">IV. But in this ſimilitude there is one, and that a notable difference, that is, when the debter hath wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the inheritance, and there is more in debt then in goods, the ſonne may renounce the inheritance, and leaue his fathers goods: But here this yeelding vp cannot be made; becauſe to the guilt by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> there commeth alſo the naturall deprauation, and contagion; like as he that is borne of parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected which leproſie, which contagion cannot be put off when they pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Although theſe things are grounded vpon the word of God, and the very rule of iuſtice, yet they ſeeme to be charged, and followed with great diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. Firſt, that in <hi>Ezekiell, Chap.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 20. doth offer it ſelfe; <hi>The ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die: The ſonne ſhall not beare the iniquity of the father:</hi> Whereunto the law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. is conſonant and agreeable; which law doth forbid children to be puniſhed for the ſinnes of their parents. Why then doe we die for anothers ſinne? Why is the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed to vs? Or is it credible, that he that forgiues vs our ſinnes, will impute to any one anothers ſins? What? that the puniſhment is greater then the ſinne? For when we ſinned in <hi>Adam</hi> onely, <hi>in potentia,</hi> in power and poſſibility, yet we are puniſhed <hi>in actu,</hi> in act: And that ſeemeth moſt cruell, that <hi>Adam,</hi> which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in act is ſaued, and for the ſame ſinne many are damned, who ſinned in <hi>Adam</hi> onely in power and poſſibility.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, the place in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> muſt be taken thus; the innocent ſonne ſhall not beare the puniſhment of his fathers ſinne: So when God ſaith in the law, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11390:40"/>he will viſit the iniquity of fathers vpon the children, he ſpeaketh of children which walke in their fathers ſteps, and are partakers of the ſame fault: But the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> cannot be ſaid to be innocent, as they which not onely ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> as in the ſtocke and roote of mankinde, but alſo themſelues are borne ſtained with the ſame deprauation, and prone to the ſame ſinne. Secondly, I ſay that that place in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> makes nothing to the preſent matter: for hee ſpeaketh of the ſinnes of the fathers, whoſe ſinnes are perſonall, and who in ſinning doe not ſuſtaine the perſons of their children: For <hi>Arminius</hi> is deceiued, in ſetting downe the cauſe why thoſe Infidels are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, who haue not refuſed the Goſpell, <hi>viz.

               <p n="6">VI. Let therefore the Schoole and followers of <hi>Arminius</hi> learne the cauſe of this difference, and why the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be imputed to his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but the ſinnes of other fathers ſhould not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to their children.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Theſe therefore I ſay, to be the cauſes of this difference. 1. Becauſe, by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> we loſt originall purity; but wee haue not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11390:40"/>loſt it by the ſinnes of our Grand-fathers, or great-Grandfathers. 2. Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> receiued gifts,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which as he had for himſelfe, ſo hee ſhould haue conueyed them to his poſterity, which ſeeing hee loſt, it iuſtly comes to paſſe that his poſterity ſhould be depriued of thoſe gifts. But my Grand-father or great-Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father receiued no ſupernatural gifts from God, which by an hereditary right they ſhould deriue to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. 3.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Then alſo the ſinnes of my Grand-father and great-Grandfather were perſonall ſinnes; neither did they in their ſinning ſuſtaine the perſons of their poſterity, which cannot be ſaid of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Tho.</hi> 1.2. <hi>queſt.</hi> 81. <hi>Art</hi> 2.</note> Surely I think that it cannot be ſaid that <hi>Ezechias</hi> or <hi>Ioſias,</hi> who were the poſterity of <hi>Dauid,</hi> did in <hi>Dauid</hi> murther <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias.</hi> 4. I will ſay ſomewhat more;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> while hee liued committed many ſinnes, yet I thinke that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becauſe onely by this ſinne he violated that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant which was made with him, as with the author of mankinde. 5.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And if any one at this day is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the light of the Goſpell, becauſe ſome of his anceſtors a thouſand yeeres ſince refuſed the Goſpell, as <hi>Arminius</hi> thinks, there is no cauſe why on the other ſide, one may not be called effectually to ſaluation, becauſe ſome one of his anceſtors beleeued the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For why ſhall the infidelity of the great-Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father be imputed to the great-grandſonne, and his faith be not imputed? But that the faith of one is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to another, <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe is not of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he ſaith out of <hi>Habacuk</hi> 2. <hi>The iuſt ſhall liue by his owne faith,</hi> and not by anothers: Nor becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> beleeued the promiſe of his ſeede, that ſhould
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11390:41"/>breake the ſerpents head, is this his faith therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to any of his poſterity. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth ſeeme to conſent to this;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> but I cannot be brought to thinke that the other ſectaries doe beleeue the ſame. 6. To beleeue that any one is reprobated, becauſe hee reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Goſpell in his greatgrandfathers, or their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is plainely conr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ary to the opinion of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. where he ſaith, <hi>that euery one ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the things done in his body, whether it be good or euill;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> therefore not according to thoſe things which he hath done in anothers body. 7. I let paſſe he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, into which <hi>Arminius</hi> by this meanes would plunge himſelfe. For it may come to paſſe, that ones Grandfather by the fathers ſide hath beleeued the Goſpell, &amp; his Grand-father by his mothers ſide hath refuſed the Goſpell. It may come to paſſe that ones Grandfathers or greatgrandfathers &amp; ſo vpward, part haue beleeued, and part haue not beleeued. I demand of which of them, in the purpoſe of God, ſhall reſpect be had? Shall the faith of the one, or the infidelitie of the other be imputed to their poſteritie? Then alſo, as often as the Goſpell is offred to any Nation or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, there is nothing ſo likely, as that ſome of thoſe people were borne of Anceſtors that were Infidels and that ſome of them were borne of faithfull Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; yet is the Goſpell offred to all without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Alſo it will come to paſſe that ſome one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of faithfull Anceſtors, may refuſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; and on the otherſide, one proceeding of Inſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 8. And if one may be an Infidell by anothers infidelity, and may be ſaid to haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Goſpell in his Anceſtors, becauſe ſome one of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11390:41"/>his progenitors refuſed the Goſpell a thouſand yeares before, there will ſcarce be any of the godly, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner hath not refuſed the Goſpell. 9.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> But what will they ſay to this? That it is found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the worſt and moſt wicked progeny of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked Anceſtors, haue beene conuerted to the faith, and as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Where ſinne abounded, there grace abounded.</hi> What were the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Romanes but theeues, depopulating and waſting the world, and a ſcourge in the hand of God? What was Corinth, but the ſtewes of all Graecia, and the Mart or faire of moſt foule luſts? yet neuertheleſſe, in thoſe cities, God by the preaching of the Goſpell, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp moſt flouriſhing Churches, and there were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many in thoſe dregges, which did belong to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of God. 10.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But if at any time the poſterity is puniſhed for the ſinnes of their Anceſtors, <hi>Arminius</hi> ought not to extend it to ſo many ages, ſeeing the law doth not extend the viſitation of the iniquity of the fathers vpon the children, beyond the third and fourth generation: And that becauſe a man can ſcarce liue ſo long, as to ſee his iſſue beyond the third or fourth generation: For therefore are children puniſhed, their fathers beholding it, that griefe might thereby increaſe to their parents, and that the fathers might be puniſhed by the miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">I. That the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> hath infected all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde with an hereditary deprauation, and that this contagion hath farre ſpred it ſelfe, hath beene abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proued by thoſe places, by which we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that euery man was conceiued and borne in ſinne. <hi>As by one man, ſinne entred into the World, and death by ſinne: ſo death went ouer all, in whom all men ſinned.

               <p n="2">II. And if any one would exactly view the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and circumſtances of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, he ſhall finde that in euery man, the character, and no obſcure image, of that firſt ſinne, is deepely impreſſed: for there is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11390:42"/>engrafted in euery man curioſity &amp; deſire of knowing thoſe thin gs which pertaine nothing to him: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a diſtruſtfull haeſitation, and doubting of the word of God: And as <hi>Adam</hi> laid the fault vpon his wife, and his wife vpon the Serpent, ſo is it naturall to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, to couer his fault with anothers fault: Alſo flight and trembling at the meeting of God, lying, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, and a ſenſe of vndecent nakedneſſe, are in all men by nature, and are deriued into poſterity from that fountaine; and to theſe things we are not taught, but made, not inſtructed, but infected: To theſe things, we doe not onely not need a maſter, but contrary to the teaching of maſters, and to diſcipline, all ſtayes and barres being broken, wee returne to them, nature being conqueror.</p>
               <p n="3">III. As therefore the egges of the Aſpe are iuſtly broken, and ſerpents new bred are iuſtly killed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue yet poyſoned none; ſo infants are rightly obnoxious, and ſubiect to puniſhments: For although they haue not yet ſinned in act, yet there is in them that contagious peſtilence, and that naturall proneneſſe to ſinne.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But hence ariſeth a queſtion hard to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, <hi>to wit,</hi> by what meanes ſinne is traduced from parents to their poſterity, and how mens ſoules may draw this deprauation. For ſeeing all things that God doth, are good; it is not credible nor likely, that God put Originall ſinne into mens ſoules: For how ſhould he puniſh thoſe ſoules, which hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had corrupted? And if he created the ſoule pure and iuſt, but being included in the body, it is defiled with the contagion, other diſcommodities no whit
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:11390:43"/>leſſe doe ariſe: For to include a pure and innocent ſoule in a ſtinking priſon, and to thruſt it, as it were, into a bridewell, that it might bee corrupted there, doth not ſeeme to agree with the iuſtice and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Hereto is added alſo, that ſin is the deprauation of the ſoule, not of the body, for ſin is a ſpirituall thing, a vice of the will; the body therefore cannot giue that to the ſoule, which it hath not: And ſeeing the body doth not ſinne, but when the ſoule doth vſe the body as an organ to ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. it is manifeſt that ſinne doth paſſe from the ſoule into the body, and not from the body into the ſoule; to which thing, the very ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is a cleere teſtimony to vs: For <hi>Adam</hi> firſt ſinned in will, before hee ſtretched forth his hand to the forbidden Apple. <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaw this, who in the firſt chapter of the ſecond booke of his Inſtitutions, hath theſe words: <hi>This contagion hath not its cauſe in the ſubſtance of the fleſh, or of the ſoule: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo appointed by God, that what gifts hee had beſtowed vpon the firſt man, he ſhould haue them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo looſe them both for himſelfe and his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Here is a way that is obſcure and ſlippery, in which we muſt goe with wary ſteppes.

Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Marcellina,</hi> and <hi>Anapſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> doth witneſſe, that the greater part of the weſt were of the ſame opinion.

               <p n="8">VIII. But we determin, that the reaſonable ſoule is infuſed into the

But we thinke that it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by God, in the fruit, and in the rudiment of mans body, being led thereto by the authority of the Scripture, whereunto reaſon, and the nature of the ſoule it ſelfe doth agree.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Moſes, Numb.</hi> 27.16. ſaith thus to God. <hi>Let the Lord, the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, ſet a man ouer the Congregation.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:11390:44"/>that God by a peculiar elegie and ſtile, is called the father of ſpirits, that he might be oppoſed to the fathers of the fleſh: for if the ſoule be by tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, thoſe that are fathers of the fleſh, would alſo be the fathers of the ſpirits: Neither ſhould God by this title be diſtinguiſhed from the fathers of the fleſh, if he wrought alike in both; and did not forme mens ſoules otherwiſe then their bodies.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Wherefore <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Chap.</hi> 12. ſaith. <hi>The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is diſſolued to duſt, and the ſpirit returneth to God that gaue it,</hi> which ſurely would not be aptly ſpoken, if God ſhould giue the ſpirit no otherwiſe then he giues the body. Certainly by that word <hi>of returning</hi> of the ſoule to God, <hi>Salomon</hi> doth inſinuate, that the ſoule came from God, and doth returne thitherwhence ſhe had her originall, which cannot be ſaid of the body.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The conception of Chriſt, in the wombe of his mother, doth adde credit to this opinion. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, according to the fleſh, he had not a father, it is plaine, that his ſoule was immediately created by God: And if it be neceſſary that thou maiſt be ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> to haue thy ſoule traducted by thy fathers ſeede, Chriſt could not be called the ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> nor of <hi>Dauid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. It is vnſauory which is brought out of the beginning of <hi>Exodus,</hi> to proue the traduction of the ſoule, <hi>Seauenty ſoules came out of the loynes of Iacob;</hi> for the propriety of the Hebrew, is well knowne, that by ſoules are vnderſtood perſons.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Alſo reaſon it ſelfe doth agree with the word of God. 1. For the ſoule, which is ſomething which is aboue nature, cannot be in a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11390:44"/>generated with other naturall things. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is immateriall, it cannot be brought forth by the power of any matter. 3. If the ſoule were not generated vnleſſe by the body, it could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body, nor could it ſubſiſt by it ſelfe alone. 4. They that would haue the ſoule to be traduced by the ſeede, doe driue themſelues into ſtraights, from which they cannot poſſible free themſelues. For why ſhould not the ſoule of the mother, be alſo traduced into the ſonne? or if the ſoule of the ſonne be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as well from the ſoule of the mother, as of the father, it muſt needs be, that two ſoules doe grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; are mingled into one. 5. What will be come of ſo much ſeede that is loſt, which either fals from them that ſleep, or is vnhoneſtly loſt, or being receiued into the wombe doth not come to conception? Will ſo many ſoules of men be loſt, or ſhall they be choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the wombe? or ſhall they remaine alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out matter, ſeeing it is certaine that they belong not to the number of men. 6. Alſo it muſt neede be, that eyther the whole ſoule of the father is traduced, and ſo the father ſhall be made ſoule-leſſe; or elſe a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and part of the ſoule; and ſo the ſoule ſhall be diuiſible. Neither can the whole ſoule be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as when light is kindled of light; for ſuch a propagation is made, by the tranſmutation of the matter applyed vnto it; and ſo the applyed matter of the begetting ſoule, ſhould be turned into the ſoule. 7. If the definition of the ſoule, laide downe by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de anima, Cap</hi> 1.) and euery where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued be true, by which he defineth the ſoule to be, <hi>the firſt act of the naturall originall body, hauing life in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:11390:45"/>power,</hi> I doe not ſee how the rationall ſoule can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and ſhape the ſeede, in which there are no Organs.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Neither is man therefore to be ſaid not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get man, although he doth not beget the ſoule, nor the ſoule be brought forth of the power of the ſeed; yet is it ſufficient for the generation of man, that in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, although he doth not giue the whole ſubſtance, yet he doth giue the ſubſiſtance of the perſon, and doth not onely ſupply the matter of the infant, but doth alſo miniſter diſpoſitions and aptitudes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that forme, by which man hath his being. For, ſeeing that by the teſtimony of the Scripture, the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> is the mother of Chriſt, although the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power of the holy-Ghoſt perfected his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; who neede doubt to affirme that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly man doth beget man, ſeeing all naturall things are done by ordinary meanes and rules. Theſe thornes being plucked vp, the way to know the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the traduction of ſinne from parents to their children, is made playner.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. In the beginning, I thinke I haue ſhewed by ſure reaſons, that ſinne doth not paſſe from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the ſoule: And on the other ſide, that God put into the ſoule this inclination to ſinne, it is a great wickedneſſe to beleeue. And yet that originall ſinne was in the ſoule, God being vnwilling, or being indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and permitting it with an idle permiſſion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſpoken or beleeued without great offence: For ſeeing Originall ſinne is the puniſhment of the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> he that ſaith that this puniſhment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted onely by the permiſſion of God, and not by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11390:45"/>his will, doth take away from God the office of a Iudge; for Iudges doe not puniſh by permitting, but by decreeing.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. For the explication of this Doctrine, we lay downe theſe ſixe propoſitions and foundations of the truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Although we had not beene borne of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet becauſe hee had receiued ſupernaturall good things, both in his owne and our name, ſeeing he loſt them by his owne fault, wee are iuſtly depriued of them: Euen as among many brethren, one doth waſte and conſume that mony to his owne and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers loſſe, which hee receiued in his owne and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God put into the ſoule theſe faculties, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Will, Senſe, &amp; Appetite, which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally carried to things that are obuious &amp; known, and not to things that are vnknowne and farre remoued.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Man cannot know and loue ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and diuine things, without diuine and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall enlightning.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Neither could man vſe thoſe things that are obuious and naturall, iuſtly and conueniently, and to the glory of God, vnleſſe ſome ſupernaturall light did ſhine forth to him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, God hath put into euery man, for his owne preſeruation, a loue of himſelfe, which loue is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good; but doth then beginne to be morally good, when it doth accord to, and helpe forward the loue of God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the manners of the minde, doe for the moſt part follow the temper of the body.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:11390:46"/>
               <p n="17">XVII. Theſe things being laid down, I ſay that God doth create the ſoules of men good, but deſtitute of heauenly gilts and ſupernaturall light, and that iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> loſt thoſe gifts for himſelfe and his poſterity, which he had receiued for himſelfe and his poſterity. Not to giue ſupernatural light to the minde is not to put into the will, although peruerſeneſle of will doth afterwards follow the blindeneſſe of the minde. For the will being deſtitute of this light, and of the knowledge of ſupernaturall good things, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not moue it ſelfe to things vnknowne, but onely to things that are preſent and knowne, ſuch as are the pleaſures of the body, riches, &amp;c. Which although they be naturally good, yet they turne the will from the ſtudy and deſire of ſupernaturall things. Then alſo ſelfe-loue, which is naturally good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, doth beginne to be morally euill, becauſe it doth inuade that place which is due to the loue of God. Hence is that proneneſſe to euill, which is in that inordinate ſelfe loue, which ſupernaturall illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not direct: which light God not giuing to the ſoule, doth not therefore put ſinne into it: No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then if one doth take away from the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller the light of the Sunne, by putting darkeneſſe betweene; be doth not force the Traueller to ſtragle, nor doth turne him from the right way; but onely he doth take away that, without which the right way cannot be knowne.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. The temper of the body doth increaſe this contagion: For it is found by experience, that ſanguine men are bloudy and libidinous, cholericke men are raſh and angry, melancholicke men are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11390:46"/>and ſtedfaſt in their purpoſes, deepely hiding their malice; blacke and yealow, choller are as ſparkes and tinder put to the appetite, by which it catcheth flames, and burnes: And according to the temper of the body, one laughes vnder the ſcourge, another weepes with a blow. The humours of the body therefore, are not cauſes, but prouocations of ſinne; neither doe they compell the will, but allure it; nor doe they impreſſe ſinne on the ſoule, but doe put forward the ſinfull ſoule, and there being may waies open to ſinne, they doe incline the ſoule hither rather then thither.</p>

                  <hi>Whether the power of beleeuing the Goſpell is loſt by the ſinne of</hi> Adam.</head>
               <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is demanded, whether by the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> we haue loſt the power of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Goſpell; <hi>Arminius,</hi> that maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous artificer of deuiſing, doth deny it: For, that he might proue that God is bound to giue to euery man power of beleeuing in Chriſt and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faith, he doth contend, that <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, had not power of beleeuing in Chriſt, nor was it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him; &amp; therefore we could not looſe in <hi>Adam,</hi> that which <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe had not. He ſaith alſo, that faith was not commanded by the law, and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> was not bound to faith, becauſe onely the law was giuen to him; he addeth alſo, that no man can beleeue, but he that is a ſinner: And if <hi>Adam</hi> did not receiue power wherby, if he fell he might riſe again, he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11390:47"/>did not receiue power of beleeuing the Goſpell, by which we riſe out of this fall.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Seeing theſe things tend thither, that <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> might make a way for himſelfe to that impious and vngodly opinion, whereby he affirmes, that God is bound to giue to all men power of beleeuing, and that God is prepared to giue faith to all men, if they themſelues will: This queſtion is of no ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor to be perfunctoriouſly and lightly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We therefore contend againſt <hi>Arminius,</hi> that mankinde by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> together with their originall purity and righteouſneſſe, loſt alſo the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of beleeuing in Chriſt. For by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> we loſt the power of louing God, and of obeying him. Now ſaith doth include the loue of God, and it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of obedience.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Adam</hi> indeede before his fall, was not bound to beleeue in Chriſt, becauſe he was not declared to him, neither then was there neede; but he was bound to beleeue euery word of God, whatſoeuer ſhould afterward be; this bond paſſed to his poſteritie: but it had not paſſed, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not beene tyed to the like bond. So the iſraelites in the time of <hi>Dauid,</hi> were not bound to beleeue, <hi>Ieremy</hi> foretelling the inſtant captiuity into Babylon, becauſe <hi>Ieremy</hi> then was not, neither was it needfull for them to know this; and yet the Iewes in contemning the propheſie of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated that law, by which the ſame people was held and bound in the time of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Hee were a foole who would ſay, that hee that hath loſt his ſight, hath not loſt the power of ſeeing that houſe which was
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11390:47"/>built foure yeares after: or that hee that is blinde by his owne fault, hath not loſt the faculty of ſeeing the collyria or plaiſters which the Phyſitian bringeth him ſome moneths after. Surely <hi>Adam,</hi> before his fall, had power of beleeuing in Chriſt, after the ſame manner that he had then power of ſuccouring and helping the ſicke and miſerable, although before the fall there was no miſery, nor could there be. <hi>Adam</hi> was in the remote power to beleeue the Goſpell, as a ſound man is in the remote power to vſe the remedies of a diſeaſe that will or may come: But that he did not beleeue in Chriſt, it was not becauſe it did exceede the power giuen him by God, but becauſe it was not needefull. Finally, ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> by his incredulity, loſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of beleeuing the word of God, it muſt needes be, that hee loſt alſo the power of beleeuing that word, by which God was to bring a remedy to this euill.</p>
               <p n="5">V. In vaine doth <hi>Arminius</hi> thinke, that it is vnapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken, if it be ſaid that <hi>Adam</hi> had power of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing when hee had no neede, which power was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, when hee began to haue neede of it. For neither was the power of beleeuing wanting to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor was it taken from him, but hee willingly loſt it, when he loſt the power of obaying God: And God of his meere grace doth reſtore the ſame to whom he will, not becauſe we will, but becauſe he worketh in vs that we will.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But that is ridiculous which <hi>Arnoldus, cap.</hi> 14. doth ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, did not receiue power, by which he might riſe, if he ſhould fall: For that power whereby men riſe, after the fall, is not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:11390:48"/>giuen before the fall, ſeeing the power is loſt by the fall; but after the fall is repaired. There is no doubt, but that <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, had ſtrength whereby he might riſe againe, if hee had not loſt it by his fall. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> therefore thus ſpeakes; as if I ſhould ſay, that hee to whom God hath giuen ſound and cleare eyes, hath not receiued power, by which he might ſee with thoſe eyes after he is made blinde,</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Finally, as many as are the poſterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> are bound to fulfill the law; this is a naturall debt; and the law commands vs to loue God, and to obey him, and therefore to beleeue him ſpeaking: When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer then Chriſt is preached, the doctrine of the Goſpell cannot be refuſed, but with the contempt of the Goſpell, the law alſo is violated. But he to whom Chriſt was neuer preached, ſhall not be condemned, becauſe he hath refuſed Chriſt, but he ſhall be iudged by the law, which tyed him to beleeue in Chriſt, if Chriſt had beene preached to him.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. And <hi>Arnoldus</hi> is plainely deceiued, when he doth affirme that the power whereby we beleeue <hi>God</hi> is one, and the power whereby they beleeue <hi>Chriſt</hi> is another; becauſe, ſaith he, the word of the law, &amp; the word of the Goſpell differ in the whole genus, and are oppoſite; this thing fell inconſiderately from the acute man: Becauſe white and blacke are oppoſite, is it therefore the property of one power to ſee white, and of another to ſee blacke? is it not the operation of the ſame faculty to know contraries? And yet I doe not ſee how the Law and the Goſpell can be ſaid to be contrary, ſeeing the Law is the Schoole-maſter to Chriſt, and the Goſpell doth miniſter the meanes,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:11390:48"/>by which the law ſhould be ſatisfied: Surely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the creditor and the ſurety, there is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Chriſt came not that hee might aboliſh the law, but that hee might fulfill it. <hi>Matthew</hi> 5.17. <hi>Romanes</hi> 3.30.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Out of theſe, it is eaſie to gather what is to be anſwered to that queſtion, whereby it is demanded, whether the law doth comand vs to beleeu in Chriſt: For this is euen as one ſhould demand whether the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> commands the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: It is plaine, that that is not expreſſely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the law; for no man was bound to beleeue <hi>Eſay</hi> before he was borne: Yet I ſay it was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the law implicitely, and by conſequence, in as much as the law doth command obedience to be yeelded to God: And God is to be obeyed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſpeake to vs immediately, or by his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: The ſame, I thinke, may be ſaide of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="10">X. For of thoſe things to which we are bound by the law, there are two kindes. Some things are due abſolutely, by all men, and at all times; yea by them to whom the law, deliuered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> hath not beene made knowne, ſuch as are to loue God and our neighbour: For <hi>Adam</hi> was indued with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe duties before the fall, and was bound to performe them in act: But there are ſome things, to the obſeruation whereof, wee are then bound by the law of God, when they are commanded in act, and when the ability of knowing them is giuen vs of God. Thus the Iſraelites in Aegypt were not bound to obey the commandement of the not gathering of Manna vpon the Saboth day, or of looking on the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:11390:49"/>bralen Serpent, or of the paſſing ouer lordan, which notwithſtanding, if any had not obeyed when God commanded them, without doubt, they had iuſtly borne the puniſhment of the breach of the law.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. But <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth wrongfully ſay, that it is not ſpoken here of that generall power of beleeuing euery word of God; for of it, it is plainely ſpoken here, ſeeing that the power of beleeuing in Chriſt, is comprehended in that generall power: No other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the power of ſeeing, doth comprehend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the power of ſeeing the remedies for blindneſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe remedies are not preſent, neither is there any neede of them before blindneſſe.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. All theſe things pertaine thither, that it might appeare, that the power of beleeuing, and of embracing the remedies which God offers in the Goſpell, is loſt by that naturall corruption which is deriued into vs from <hi>Adam:</hi> And therefore that <hi>Arminius</hi> doth erre, when hee ſaith, that God is bound to giue to all men power to beleeue in Chriſt, or that he is prepared to giue faith to all. For, God is not bound to reſtore to man that which man loſt by his owne fault; nor doth he deale vniuſtly, when he requireth of man, that which hee doth naturally owe.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Arminius</hi> is not conſtant to himſelfe in this thing, and doth pluck vp thoſe things which hee laid downe: For he ſaith, that many nations haue for many ages beene depriued of the light of the Goſpell, without which, yet there is no faith, and that for a puniſhment of the incredulitie of their anceſtors: He doth acknowledge, therefore, that God hath not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11390:49"/>giuen, nor was prepared to giue to theſe nations, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of beleeuing in Chriſt. Yea truely <hi>Arminius,</hi> in ſpeaking thus, doth ſet downe the cauſe why God would not, and therefore was not prepared to giue to people that, without which, faith cannot be. Was God prepared to giue to the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> the power of beleeuing, of whom Chriſt giueth this teſtimony, that they would haue conuerted in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath and Aſhes, if the word and his miracles had come to them? Doth he giue power of beleeuing to them whoſe hearts he hardneth with his vnreſiſtable will, as <hi>Arminius</hi> ſpeakes? Could they beleeue of whom, it is ſpoken, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.39. <hi>Therefore they could not beleeue, becauſe it is written, he hath blinded their eyes, and hath hardned their hearts?</hi>

               <p n="14">XIV. Here <hi>Arminius</hi> doth not obſcurely accuſe God of folly; for he will haue God to be aduerſe to himſelfe, and to be prepared to doe that, which that it might not be done, he taketh an incongruent and diſagreeable courſe; nay, like a iudge, hee ſets lawes for God himſelfe; for what elſe meane theſe words, <hi>God is bound</hi> to giue the power of beleeuing? Surely it ſeemes that <hi>Arminius</hi> doth binde God by this Law: neither will God haue any reaſon for his iuſtice, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Arminius</hi> ſupply to him the meanes, whereby he may auoide the crime of iniuſtice.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. And although that impotency and diſabilitie of beleeuing be a puniſhment of the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:11390:50"/>yet he is not vniuſtly puniſhed, who by this impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency hath refuſed the Goſpell, becauſe the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency or diſability, which is a puniſhment, is alſo a fault, which I ſay, that it might appeare how vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth here vſe the examples of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are not faults. <hi>Is it equity</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that to a Souldier that hath beene puniſhed with the loſſe of his eyes, for not keeping good watch, the Generall ſhould offer the pardon of ſome other fault, or ſhould promiſe ſome other thing, with this condition, that he ſhould watch more diligently, and then puniſh him, becauſe that being blinde, he hath not watched:</hi> This example is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for to be blinde is not a fault, neither is any man by a naturall obligation bound to ſee: It is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with our impotency to beleeuing. Beſides, hee that is puniſhed with the loſſe of his eyes, is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and doth heauily beare the loſſe of the light. But man therefore doth not beleeue, becauſe he will not beleeue, and this impotency is voluntary.</p>

               <p n="3">III. By this Goſpell, eternall life is promiſed to thoſe that beleeue in Chriſt: For as there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation without Chriſt; ſo without faith, Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be apprehended, nor can we come to the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appointed onely for the faithfull: For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, <hi>Without faith it is vnpoſsible to pleaſe God:</hi> I call faith, not that vaine truſt whereby men ſleepe in their vices, and their conſciences are benumbed, while they haue a good hope of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God; but a liuely faith, <hi>which doth worke by charitie, Gal.</hi> 5.6. which by that very meanes doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe loue, becauſe it driues away feare.</p>
               <p n="4">IV.

               <p n="6">VI. Faith is giuen by the meer good pleaſure of God, neither is it giuen to the worthy, but it doth make them worthy when it is giuen: For God doth not find men good, but makes them ſo; neither doth he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know any good in man but, that which hee himſelfe ſhall doe: as hereafter ſhall more fully be taught.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. This eternall, and therefore immutable decree of God, is called Predeſtination; which is a part of the prouidence of God: For prouidence is called Predeſtination, when it doth apply it ſelfe to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation or condemnation of the reaſonable creature; and when it doth diſpenſe and diſpoſe the meanes, by which men come to ſaluation; for that theſe things are gouerned by the diuine will, and that God according to his good pleaſure doth giue to ſome, that which he doth deny to others, cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For though the Scripture were here ſilent, yet reaſon would cry out, that it is not likely, that God, who doth extend his care to all things, is negligent in this thing alone, which is the chiefeſt.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Furthermore, although there be a Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation among the Angels, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, who 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21. calleth the Angels <hi>Flect:</hi> Here we are to deale onely with the predeſtination of men, as that which alone belongs to vs.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Predeſtination is therefore the decree, by which in the worke of our ſaluation, God hath from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11390:51"/>eternity determined what hee will doe with euery man. Or thus: Predeſtination is the decree of God, by which, of the corrupted maſſe of mankinde, hee hath decreed to ſaue certaine men by Chriſt, and iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to puniſh the reſt for their ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Of this Predeſtination there are two parts; the one is election, the other is reprobation, whereof the firſt doth neceſſarily lay downe the ſecond: For, as often as ſome are choſen out of many, the reſt are neceſſarily reprobated: and of them that are choſen, ſome are preferred before others.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Of election, and of the Elect, there is often mention in the Scripture. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen. Math.</hi> 20.16. <hi>God hath choſen vs in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundations of the world were laid. Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>The purpoſe of God according to election doth ſtand, not of workes, but of him that calleth. Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>There is a remnant according to the election of grace.

               <p n="14">XIV. An example of this difference God hath ſhewed, not onely in <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo in his ſtocke, which for no deſert of theirs, hee preferred before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, <hi>When the moſt high diuided to the Nations their inheritance, when he ſeperated the ſonnes of</hi> Adam, <hi>the Londs portion was his people,</hi> Iacob <hi>was the lot of his inheritance, Deut.</hi> 32.

               <p n="15">XV. And although Predeſtination doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend reprobation; ſeeing that it is certaine, that the wicked are appointed to a certaine end, and to their deſerued puniſhments: yet the Apoſtle, by the word <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> doth vnderſtand onely <hi>Election,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Thoſe that he predeſtinated, he called, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Hauing predeſtinated vs to the adoption of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

               </p>
               <p n="16">XVI. But when concerning this doctrine, diuers men thinke diuerſly; yet <hi>Arminius</hi> alone hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the nature of Predeſtination leſſe then any other, and doth greatly ſtumble in the very entrance. He in his Theologicall diſputations. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 13. <hi>The.</hi> 3. ſaith, that the <hi>genus</hi> and generall of Predeſtination is the decree, and that (ſaith hee) <hi>not the legall decree, according to which it is ſaid, the man that doth them ſhall liue in them: but the Euangelicall decree, which ſpeaketh thus: This is the will of God, that euery one that ſeeth the ſonne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in him, ſhould haue life eternall</hi> And all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians following him, doe comprehend the whole doctrine of Predeſtination in foure decrees: The firſt they will haue to be that, whereby God decreed to ſend his ſonne to redeeme mankinde: The ſecond, that whereby he decreed to giue eternall life to them that beleeue: The third, that, whereby he decreed to giue all men grace, and ſufficient power to beleeue: The fourth, that, whereby he decreed to giue ſaluation to theſe, and they particular men whom he fore-knew would beleeue, and would perſeuere in the faith; and as the linkes of a Chaine, they ſo knit theſe that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter decrees depend on the former, and by the former, the way is to the latter.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. By theſe things it is plaine, that <hi>Arminius</hi> did not vnderſtand what the decree of Predeſtination was: For the decree of Predeſtination is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God hath appointed what he will doe with vs, and not what he would haue vs doe: Vntowardly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth <hi>Arminius</hi> place, among the decrees of God,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11390:53"/>that will of God, whereby he hath appointed thoſe to be ſaued, who ſhall beleeue, ſeeing that in this will the commandement of God is included: <hi>Arminius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the ſame place doth comprehend Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder prouidence, and doth make predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or part of prouidence: If therefore that ſpeech, <hi>hee that beleeueth, ſhall be ſaued,</hi> is not the decree of prouidence, certainely it will not be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of predeſtination; ſeeing Predeſtination is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then prouidence, reſtrained to the ſaluation or reprobation of men. This doth plainely appeare from thence, that <hi>Arminius</hi> doth oppoſe this decree, which hee cals Euangelicall, to the legall decree, by which it is ſaid, <hi>He that ſhall doe theſe things, ſhall liue in them;</hi> which is manifeſtly, not the decree of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but the rule of iuſtice: And if not this, then certainely not the other, ſeeing the rules of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell doe no more belong to the prouidence of God, and therefore not to predeſtination, then the rules of the Law.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Therefore of thoſe foure decrees, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is to be wiped out, and a place to be appointed for it in the doctrine of the Goſpell, and not in the eternall decree and ſecret predeſtmation. And ſo of thoſe foure linkes, the ſecond being taken away, the whole chaine is broken, and as it were, one pin being drawne out, the whole ioyning together of that frame is looſed and diſſolued.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. Nay what? that <hi>Arminius</hi> doth altogether ouerthrow Election, and make it to be a thing onely of name?

               <p n="20">XX. And when <hi>Arminius</hi> will haue all men to be elected by a conditionall election; that is, ſo they will beleeue, and by their free will, rightly vſe the grace which is offred them: he doth lay downe an election which is not an election, becauſe it is equally extended to all: He doth not elect, that doth not preferre ſome before others. What? that by this generall election, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Simon Peter</hi> were equally elected? and the election is extended to <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">XXI. But that is the moſt dangerous that <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> doth make the election of ſeuerall men to come after faith, and ſo doth make the election of God to depend on mans free-will: Whence it comes to paſſe, that the ſaluation of man is a thing meerely contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent &amp; not neceſſary, becauſe it depends vpon a thing that is contingent &amp; mutable, <hi>to wit,</hi> vpon mans wil. For although God doth certainly fore-know thoſe contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent caſuall things, which are to be after; yet is not therefore the election or ſaluation of man neceſſary,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11390:54"/>for a thing is not therefore certaine, becauſe it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely fore-knowne. And becauſe election, is not an act of the fore-knowledge of God, but of his will; the execution whereof (if we may giue credit to <hi>Arminius</hi>) doth depend on the fulfilling of the condition, which may be hindred by man: For the Schoole and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Arminius,</hi> are of opinion, that euery man hath power of beleeuing, and that God <hi>is bound</hi> to giue to all men power of fulfilling the condition of the ſecond couenant,

                  </note> and that the grace of God is but the cauſe in part of faith, and that it is not begot in man by the grace of God alone.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. So while the Arminians will haue euery particular perſon to be elected by God, for faith fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene; that is, that they are certainely appointed to ſaluation whom God fore-ſeeth will come, when they ſhall be called, and will perſeuere, they doe plainely deny them to be elected: For to receiue all that come, is not to elect or chooſe; for although the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> will haue both precedent and concomitant grace to be giuen by God, yet they will haue it in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mans free will, to refuſe grace, or not to refuſe it. Surely <hi>Arminius</hi> would haue God to predeſtinate thoſe to ſaluation, whom he from eternity fore-ſaw would by their owne free-will vſe aright his grace. But I deny that this can be called Election, ſeeing it is rather a decree of admitting thoſe that will come to Chriſt, when they might not come: who (if <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> doctrine get place) doe firſt chooſe God and apply themſelues to him, before they be appointed to ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uation by God.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. I let paſſe, that <hi>Arminius</hi> will haue parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:11390:54"/>men ſo to be elected for faith fore-ſeene, that they belong to the election, not whom hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, but whom he hath fore-ſeene will perſeuere in the faith vntill death. Whence it comes, that God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth none, vnleſſe he be conſidered as dead, or elſe in the very point betweene life and death; which if it be true, <hi>Arminius</hi> doth ſay amiſſe, when he ſaith, that beleeuers are elected: for he ſhould ſay, that they are elected, who ceaſe to beleeue.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. Adde to this, that new and prodigious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> whereby they thinke that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates may be ſaued, and thoſe which are elect may be damned, not as they are the reprobate or the elect, but as they are indued with power to beleeue, and to come to ſaluation. But if he which is a reprobate by the decree of God, may be ſaued, and hee which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected may be damned, it is plaine, that Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not the decree of God, but a thing onely in title, and a floting will, or meere and bare fore-knowledge; the certainty whereof doth depend vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing of an vncertaine thing, <hi>to wit,</hi> mans free-will. Who, I pray, would endure a man ſpeaking thus? <hi>I am indeede a reprobate, but I can effect that I ſhould be ſaued;</hi> or, <hi>I am elected, but it is in my power to effect that I ſhould be reprobated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">XXV. If therefore the certainty of election ſhould be made to depend vpon mans will, it might come to paſſe, that no man ſhould beleeue in Chriſt, and ſo Chriſt had died in vaine.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI.
<note place="margin">See Sect. 16.</note> But by that ſeries and order of the foure decrees, whereby Chriſt is appointed to death, before God had determined who ſhould be ſaued; Chriſt is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:11390:55"/>made the head of the Church, without any certaine members, which is meere dotage: For Chriſt is fained to be giuen to be the head of the Church, without the certaine will of God, what ſhould afterward be his body. Yea, by the doctrine of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> it may come to paſſe, that Chriſt ſhould be a head without a body, and the Church ſhould be none at all, for they thinke that there is none of the elect which may not be damned.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. This alſo is not to be omitted, that the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> to the end they might maintain that concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or linking together of the foure decrees, doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Chriſt died, not for the faithfull, but for all men indiſtinctly; not more for <hi>Peter,</hi> then for <hi>Iudas;</hi> and that Chriſt in his death, had not determined whom he would ſaue by his death; yea, that when Chriſt dyed, election had no place, becauſe election is a thing after the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. The example of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and of <hi>Iudas,</hi> is here of ſpeciall weight: For by the doctrine of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> God electeth all men vnder this condition, that they beleeue in the death of Chriſt. I demand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whether God choſe <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vnder this condition, that they ſhould beleeue in the death of Chriſt? This ſurely cannot be ſaid; becauſe God had decreed to vſe the wickedneſſe of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> to deliuer Chriſt to death. How could they be elected to ſaluation, vnder the cond ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of beleeuing in the death of Chriſt, who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to that very thing, that by their incredu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Paſtors of the <hi>Valacrian</hi> Churches, ſtrong main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of the truth, in their moſt exact Epiſtle, the coppy whereof they haue ſent to vs, doe profeſſe that they thinke that God conſidered thoſe men which hee did elect, and which hee did paſſe by, as fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> and dead in ſinnes: All the anciens thinke ſo, to none of whom (as farre as I know) it euer came in their minde to ſay that God reprobated men without the beholding of ſinne. I ſee that of the ſame opinion is <hi>Caluin, Zanchy, Melanchton, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Muſculus, Pareus,</hi> famous lights in this age of the Church, out of whoſe writings, I haue added ſome gathered ſentences at the end of this worke, leaſt they ſhould ſtay the haſtening reader, and ſhould breake off the thread of the diſputation begunne
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:11390:56"/>againſt the <hi>Arminians:</hi> The confeſſion of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of France doth keepe it ſelfe within theſe limits, in the twelth Article, where out of the ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and other places of Scripture, Election and Reprobation is proued to be out of the corrupt maſſe. The reuerend <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dordt</hi> (then which for many ages there hath beene none more famous, nor more holy) harh allowed this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: I doe not ſee what can be oppoſed to ſo great authority.

               <p n="1">I. Firſt, that Phraſe of Scripture which calleth the Elect, <hi>the veſſels of mercy,</hi> offers it ſelfe: Now there is no place for mercy vnleſſe towards the miſerable. He cannot be elected to the ſaluation, to be obtained by Chriſt, vnleſſe he be conſidered as one that hath neede of a redeemer: And ſeeing that the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to an end, doth include the meanes by which that end is come by, and the meanes to ſaluation is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:11390:56"/>the remiſſion of ſinnes, nor is there remiſſion of ſinnes without ſinne, it is plaine that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſaluation, who are conſidered as ſinners.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Neither could God, with the preſeruation of his iuſtice, puniſh thoſe men whom he conſidered without ſin, for God doth not puniſh the guiltles: Damnation is an act of the iuſtice of God, which iuſtice cannot ſtand, or agree with it ſelf, if innocent man for no fault be appointed to that deſertion, and forſaking, which eternall deſtruction muſt neceſſarily follow; or if God had determined to deſtroy men, before he did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to create them.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Then as God doth not condemne, vnleſſe it be for ſin; ſo it is certaine that hee is not willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, vnleſſe it be for ſin: But to reprobate men, &amp; to be willing to condemne, are the ſame thing, euen as to elect &amp; to be willing to ſaue, is the ſame thing: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth not reprobate vnleſſe it be for ſinne.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Furthermore it cannot be denied, but that reprobation or reiection of the creature from God, is the puniſhment which can be inflicted on the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, becauſe eternall torments doe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow it, which if we get to be granted; it will thence follow, that it is not the part of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and higheſt iuſtice to forſake his owne creature, and that not becauſe he hath ſinned, but becauſe it ſo ſeemed good to God, that hee might ſeeke matter for his glory out of the deſertion, and forſaking of the ſoule which hee created. Can the father, who knoweth that the happineſſe of his ſonne depends on him, without the crime of cruelty, and want of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection, forſake his ſonue that is innocent, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:11390:57"/>found guilty of no wickedneſſe, eſpecially if by this forſaking, his ſon ſhould fall into eternall torments, and by it be made not onely moſt miſerable, but alſo moſt wicked?</p>
               <p n="5">V. Neither ſhould God deale iuſtly, if he ſhould giue more euill to the creature, by infinite parts, then he hath giuen good: To which, when he had giuen <hi>eſſe,</hi> a beeing, a while after, without any fault of it, he gaue it, <hi>male eſſe,</hi> an euill and miſerable being, for euer. Indeede if God ſhould onely take away that he hath giuen, and ſhould bring the creature to nothing, there were no cauſe at all of complaining: But to giue an infinite euill to that creature, to whom he gaue a finite good, and to create man to that end onely that he might deſtroy him, that out of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction he might get glory to himſelfe, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and iuſtice of God abhorreth.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Yet this is the moſt grieuous thing, that by this, eyther reprobation or deſertion of man, being conſidered without ſinne, the innocent is made not onely moſt miſerable, but euen moſt wicked: For the auerſion and turning away of the will, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow the denying of the ſpirit of God; and ſeeing according to this opinion, God hated man, that was made by him, before man hated God, it cannot come to paſſe, but that the hatred of God, whereby he hates man, by the ſame opinion, ſhould be made the cauſe of that hatred whereby man hates God, and ſo God ſhould be made the author of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. And if God hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> being conſidered in the vncorruptible maſſe, as not a ſinner, it muſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:11390:57"/>needes be, that God hates the innocent creature; and hatred in God, although it is not an humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor a perturbation, yet it is a ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine will of puniſhing, and puniſhment cannot be iuſt, if it be without offence; neither can a man be iuſtly puniſhed, vnleſſe he be conſidered as a ſinner.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. If any man ſhould ſay that God is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, or ſubiect to no lawes, and therefore his actions are not rightly examined, according to the rule of iuſtice, ſeeing hee is tyed to no rules: I will anfwere, that the nature of God, is more mighty then any law: That naturall perfection, by which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that God ſhould lie, or that he ſhould ſinne; is alſo the cauſe, why he could not hate his guiltleſſe creature, or appoint man to eternall torments, for no fault of his: Yea if theſe things were true, it were the part of a wiſe man to ſuppreſſe theſe things, not to moue this anagyris or offenſiue matter, and rather to command ſilence or ignorance to themſelues, then to breake into theſe ſecrets, which being declared, doe caſt in ſcruples and doubts, and yeeld occaſion to the aduerſaries, of defaming the true religion, and by which, no man is made fitter to the duties of a Chriſtian, or of a ciuill man, or to any part of piety.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. That could not eſcape which ſhould ſay, that by reprobation, men are not appointed to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but onely are paſſed by, or not elected, Thus they ſeeke gentler words, that by them the ſame thing might be ſaid; for it is all one, whether God doth appoint a man to damnation, or doth that, from
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:11390:58"/>which damnation muſt neceſſarily follow. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God doth not elect, whether hee be ſaid to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and paſſed by, or to be reprobated, hee is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies excluded from the grace of God, damnation doth certainely follow this excluding; becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the grace of election, there is no ſaluation. For ſeeing it is manifeſt to all, that men by election, are appointed to ſaluation, I would haue it told mee, to what they that are not elected, but paſſed by, are appointed: Surely if election doth appoint men to ſaluation, it is plaine, that by reprobation, which is called <hi>omiſsion</hi> or paſſing by, the reſt are excluded from ſaluation, and appointed to deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="10">X. And if God haue appointed the innocent creature to deſtruction, it muſt needes be, that hee hath appointed it to ſinne, without which, there can be no iuſt deſtruction, and ſo God would be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiue and mouing cauſe of ſinne: Neither could man iuſtly be puniſhed for that ſinne, to which he is eyther preciſely appointed, or compelled by the will of God.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That the decrees of God are eternall, and that he hath fore-knowne all things from eternity, doth not hinder this opinion, which doth maintaine, God in election and reprobation, to haue conſidered man as fallen, before he conſidered him as condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For although the decrees of God are certaine, yet there is ſome order among them; as the eternall decree of ouerthrowing the world by fire, was in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after the decree of creating the world: So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God, from eternity, had appointed the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to puniſhment, yet nothing hinders but that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:11390:58"/>the conſideration, whereby hee conſidered men as ſinners, ſhould be in order before that whereby hee conſidered men as reprobate, or appointed to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Neither doth it follow of the opinion of the reuerend Synod, and the confeſſion of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by which man fallen is the obiect of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that God created man to an vncertaine end, or to haue miſſed of that end which he propounded to himſelfe. The laſt end, propounded to God, was the illuſtration, and ſetting forth of his glory, by the manifeſtation of his goodneſſe and iuſtice; that hee might come to this end, hee decreed to create man iuſt, but mutable and free: The fore-knowledge of the fall of man doth follow this decree, not in time, but in order, and election and reprobation doth in order follow this fore-knowledge.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. They are very farre from the truth, which would haue God, in electing and reprobating, to haue conſidered man as not created; for they doe as much as if they ſhould ſay, that God conſidered man as nothing, and therefore as not man. Surely in that very thing, that they call him a man, they call him ſomewhat; but to conſider ſomething as nothing is a thing well-nigh a dreame: He that will ſaue or puniſh a man, muſt neceſſarily, firſt haue willed him to be a man: For if God had appointed man to puniſhment before he had appointed to create him, he ſhould ſo doe, as if any one ſhould determine to beate his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, before he hath determined to beget them.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Finally, ſeeing the firſt act of his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency was buſied about nothing, it muſt neede, be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:11390:59"/>that it went before the act of his mercy or iuſtice, which cannot be buſied but about ſomething that hath being.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. They ſay the ſame thing in other words, which would haue God in predeſtinating to haue conſidered man, as one that might be created and might fail: For he which ſaith he might be created, ſaith he was not yet created; and hee that ſaith hee might fall, ſaith that he had not fallen, but that to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconueniences, they adde this increaſe, that they put a power and potentiall faculty in that thing which is nothing In God indeede there was the actiue power of creating the world, before he created it: But there was not in the world the paſſiue power for creating, before it was created: So neither could there be power for the creation, or for the fall, in man being not created, and it is plainely contrary to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that of him which is not, it ſhould be ſaid that he may fall. Then alſo if God elected man that might be created, what doth hinder that it may not be ſaid, that he elected ſome whom hee neuer would create? For theſe alſo may be created; but if God elected thoſe whom he preſuppoſed hee would create, the will of creating muſt needes goe before the election.</p>

               <p n="1">I. SAint <hi>Paul</hi> keepes himſelfe within theſe limits, in the ninth chapter to the Romanes, where hee ſpeaketh more fully, and more exactly of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:11390:59"/>election and reprobation, then any where elſe. For if he had written with a beame of the Sunne, it could not more cleerely appeare, that he ſpeakes of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted maſſe, and of the will of God, by which of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, one is choſen, and the other reprobated.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſcope of the Apoſtle, is to beate back the vaine confidence of the Iewes, who boaſted in the law, and in the righteouſneſſe of their workes, to whom it did ſeeme an abſurd and impoſſible thing that the Iſraelites, or the greater part of them, fell from the couenant of God, and were not reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſonnes of God. That hee might pull this ſcruple out of their mindes, and might waſh away this pride; he fetcheth the matter from the very ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and doth deny that carnall propagation, or the righteouſneſſe of workes, is the cauſe why any one is to be reckoned the ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the good pleaſure of God, and the free election of grace, by which God, of the iſſue of <hi>Abraham,</hi> choſe whom he would, and whom he would hee reiected; hath mercy of whom he would, and whom he would hee hardned: and of the ſame maſſe, hath prepared ſome veſſels for honour, and hath patiently endured the veſſels prepared for deſtruction. To which purpoſe he bringeth two paire of examples, <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmaell, Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> and he doth lay downe <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> as ſonnes of the promiſe, and examples of the free election of grace; but <hi>Iſhmaell</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of reiection: And he doth ſeeme of purpoſe to adde the example of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> for a <hi>prolepſis,</hi> or preuention of an obiection. For the Iewes might except, that therefore the difference was betweene
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:11390:60"/>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmaell,</hi> becauſe the one was of the ſeruant, the other of the free woman: Then alſo becauſe when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> already had ſhewed the ſignes of an euill diſpoſition, and had done thoſe things, for which hee ought to be excluded from the couenant. The Apoſtle doth fitly preuent this obiection, by the example of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> who both were the ſonnes of the free woman, and neither of them had done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good or euill, yet God loued the one, and hated the other.</p>
               <p n="3">III. All theſe things are brought by the Apoſtle, that he might teach in what reſpect God choſe ſome of the Iewes, and reprobated others, although they were puft vp with the opinion of legall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: This nation ſeeing it was impure and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, it could not be compared to the pure maſſe: And the Apoſtle ſhould plainely ſpeake beſides the matter if he ſhould vſe the example of the vndefiled maſſe, to teach how God out of a corrupted nation choſe ſome, and reprobated others.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The examples of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> doe conuince and proue the ſame thing, of whom, when they were in the wombe, and had done neither good nor euill, God doth pronounce, that he loued <hi>Iacob,</hi> that hee hated <hi>Eſau.</hi> Now God could not conſider theſe twins in the wombe, but he muſt conſider them ſuch as they were: &amp; they were corrupted &amp; defiled with originall ſinne. Surely he cannot be ſaid to be preferred before the other, becauſe he was better when he was in the womb, ſeeing neither of them had done good or euill. This is that with which S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſtop the mouth of theſe queſtioniſts, and will not haue any to plead
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:11390:60"/>againſt God, or anſwere him againe; ſeeing there is no cauſe but the meere good pleaſure of God, why, of two that were equally euill, he preferred the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Neither is there any ſmall force in theſe words; <hi>I haue hated:</hi> for God could not hate the creature whom he conſidered as pure and voide of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is no light thing that hee ſo deſcribeth the elect, <hi>to wit,</hi> that they are they <hi>whom God will haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on. ver.</hi> 18. whence alſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. they are called <hi>the veſſels of mercy:</hi> for mercy preſuppoſeth miſery. They force the words of the Apoſtle, who by <hi>miſereri,</hi> to haue mercy, vnderſtand ſimply <hi>benefacere,</hi> to doe well. I ſhould doubt and make conſcience to affirme, that God had had mercy on Chriſt as man, on whom yet he hath beſtowed more gifts, then on any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. There is great weight alſo in the word <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: he hardneth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>whom he will.</hi> As by thoſe on whom God will haue mercy, the Elect are vnderſtood; ſo by them that are hardned, the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate are vnderſtood: And to thinke that God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to harden that man, whom hee conſidereth as pure, &amp; as in the incorrupted eſtate, is great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and contumelious againſt the iuſtice of God: By this meanes God ſhould not onely puniſh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, but alſo depraue and corrupt the guiltleſſe. For obduration and hardning is a <hi>ſpecies</hi> and kinde of puniſhment, and therefore after ſinne; God hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth none, but he who is already hard; ſo he hardned <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he being already ſtubborne, and prone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell of his owne diſpoſition.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:11390:61"/>
               <p n="8">VIII. Neither is there neede of much wit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is no fit example of reprobation, out of the incorrupted Maſſe, and of a man conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without ſinne.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. It is alſo greatly to be obſerued, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking of reprobates, doth ſay that they are veſſels, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

It is not without conſideration that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would not after the ſame manner ſpeake in both places, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe God found ſome veſſels fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to deſtruction, but made others veſſels appointed to glory, and that by hauing mercy on them.</p>

               <p n="1">I. He faines that the Apoſtles minde is to teach, that they onely of the Iewes were to be reckoned the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who letting paſſe iuſtification by the law, doe follow after righteouſneſſe and faith; and the purpoſe, according to Election, hee denyeth to be the decree of the election of ſeuerall men, but the generall and condition all decree of ſauing all, who were to beleeue: By which decree <hi>Arminius</hi> will haue all men to be elected conditionally, which ſurely is no election, ſeeing election is not, but of ſeueral men, who are choſen out of the multitude, others being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I confeſſe indeede, that the doctrine of election
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:11390:62"/>by free grace, doth make the way to the doctrine of righteouſneſſe, by faith; yet all this diſpute of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> concerning election, which reacheth from the ſixt verſe to the thirteenth, doth not deale of iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith, neither would the Apoſtle proue in this place, that man is iuſtified by faith, or that God doth elect thoſe which apprehend Chriſt by faith: But by the doctrine of election, doth frame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an entrance, to the treatiſe of iuſtification by faith, which afterwards he addes. Hee would here proue this one thing, that man is not truely the ſonne of the promiſe by the workes of the law, but by the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of free grace, and by the mercy of God; for it is manifeſt, that here workes are not oppoſed to faith, but to election, and to God calling. So Verſe the 11. he doth not ſay, <hi>not by workes, but by faith;</hi> but he ſaith, <hi>not by workes, but by him that calleth.</hi> So Verſe 16. when he had ſaid, <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth;</hi> hee doth not adde, <hi>but of him that beleeueth:</hi> What then? <hi>but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. For when it is ſpoken of the cauſe, why, of two that are equally conceiued in ſinne (ſuch as were <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi>) God ſhould preferre the one afore the other, the onely mercy of God, and the election by grace, is to be conſidered, and not faith, which is not the cauſe, but the effect of our election, neither doth it goe before election, but followeth it. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25. ſaith, <hi>that he obtained mercy from God to be faithfull,</hi> and not becauſe he was after to be ſo. Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in all this ſpeech wherein hee ſpeaks of the cauſe of the difference which God makes betweene two that were by nature alike, makes no
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11390:62"/>mention of faith: But this Treatiſe being finiſhed, he doth deſcend, verſe 30. to the righteouſneſſe of faith, as to the fruit which doth follow election.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But <hi>Arminius</hi> for the ſafegard of his cauſe, doth change the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and doth thruſt in ſomething of his owne:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 27.</note> For in the place of that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>not of workes, but of him that calleth,</hi> he doth ſubſtitute theſe his words, feigned by himſelfe; <hi>not of worke, but of faith, whereby God calling ſhould be obeyed:</hi> when notwithſtanding in all that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which dealeth concerning election, there is no mention made of faith, neither doth the leaſt ſteppe thereof appeare.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is meruailous, how much <hi>Arminius</hi> doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the examples of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> He doth contend, that they are here propounded, not as examples, but as types of them who followed after righteouſneſſe by workes, not by faith. Certainely there muſt be ſome agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the type, and the thing ſignified by the type. But who euer heard it ſaid, that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> would haue beene iuſtified by the workes of the Law, and not by faith? ſeeing at that time the law was not giuen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were theſe differences of iuſtification by the law, and by faith knowne; neither is it credible, that <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> euer thought of or regarded theſe things: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Arminius</hi> doth as much as if <hi>Nimrod</hi> ſhould be made a type of the Phariſaicall righteouſneſſe.

Hence is bred an obiection: whether God be vniuſt, who giueth vnlike things to them that are alike; and why he hath not mercy on both? What ſaith <hi>Arminius</hi> here? Why, hee takes theſe things, as if <hi>Paul</hi> demanded whether there is iniuſtice with God, who excludes thoſe from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, who would be iuſtified by the Law, which he himſelfe made, and who would haue them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt, to be iuſtified. This is a bould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, whereof there is no ſtep nor mention in that which went before. But if it be lawfull for any one to mingle and adde to the Scripture ſo many things out of his owne wit, there is nothing ſo abſurd or impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which may not be proued out of the Scripture. What? that there is no color nor reaſon for this here? for what ſhew is there here of iniuſtice in God? or who is ſo mad that he will expoſtulare with God, becauſe he will iuſtifie by faith in Chriſt, and obſolue them that are guilty of the breach of the law?

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers no ſuch thing, but doth bring in God himſelfe, anſwering thus; <hi>I will haue mercy on whom I will haue mercy, and I will haue compaſsion on whom I will haue compaſsion:</hi> which words, doe not ſpeake of iuſtification by faith, but of the free election of God, whereby of two men alike conceiued in ſinne, and alike guilty, one is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the other: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay, that becauſe the law is violated therefore there is neede of mercy; but he doth bring the cauſe of this difference betweene thoſe that are equall by nature; <hi>I will haue mercy on whom I will haue mercy:</hi> According to <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> hee ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>I will haue mercy by what meanes I will &amp; I will make ſuch a couenant as ſhall pleaſe my ſelfe.</hi> For he will haue God not to ſpeake of the election of ſeuerall men, but of the manner, which it pleaſeth God to chooſe to exerciſe his mercy: As if he had ſaid, <hi>I will haue mercy as I will;</hi> and not, <hi>I will haue mercy, cuius volo, on whom I will:</hi> Surely this word <hi>Cuius, of whom,</hi> doth put this queſtion to flight, and doth make dull the weake wit of <hi>Arminius:</hi> for this word marketh out particular perſons, and not the manner whereby God doth exerciſe his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: For he that asked the queſtion; <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, is there iniuſtice with God?</hi> moued the doubt concerning the hardning and reiection of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, &amp; not concerning the manner by which it ſeemed good to God to ſaue men, or to haue mercy on them.</p>

               <p n="5">V. Beſides this generall and conditionall election, by which all men without exception are elected, they make another election of particular men, which doth reſt &amp; relye on faith foreſeene. This they define to be the abſolute decree of God, of ſauing ſome certaine men, whom he from eternity fore-ſaw would beleeue in Chriſt, and perſeuere in the faith, which faith and perſeuerance, they ſay, is conſidered in the decree of election, as already fulfilled: The ſame men are alſo of opinion, that this election, while wee are pilgrimes vpon earth, is incompleate, and reuocable: For ſo <hi>Greninchouius, P.</hi> 136.137. <hi>As the good things of our ſaluation, which are continued, faith being continued, and are reuoked and called backe, faith being denied, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleate; ſo election is in this life incompleate, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory, not irreuocable:</hi> But the courſe of election being finiſhed, they will haue this decree then to bee compleate and irreuocable.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. They will haue the will of God, of ſauing ſome certaine men, to be after the will of man, and to depend vpon the fore-ſeeing of faith.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. They will haue that firſt election to belong to the antecedent will, the latter election to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent will.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That God doth ſupply tomen the meanes to beleeue, they thinke it to be the act of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and not of this election, whereby hee hath appointed ſome certaine men to glory: and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie true faith and perſeuerance in faith, to be an
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11390:67"/>effect of this latter and abſolute election: ſeeing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe election doth rather depend on the fore-ſeeing of that faith, and faith is before election: For they denie that God hath preciſely predeſtinated any one to faith, but they will haue it, that they that haue faith are predeſtinated to ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. They comprehend the whole doctrine of election in foure decrees, which they ſo knit among themſelues with a perpetuall linking, that the latter depend on the former.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The 1. decree of God, is of giuing his ſon for the aboliſhing of ſin, &amp; for the redemption of al mankind, in which redemption, they would haueal mankind to be reconciled, and remiſſion of ſins to be obtained for all. The 2. decree, that whereby God decreed to ſaue them that beleeue, &amp; would perſeuere in faith: This is that generall &amp; conditionall election. The 3. decree, is that wherby God decreed to giue to all men ſufficient grace for faith &amp; repentance: which power, they ſay, is giuen irreſiſtably, yea; and that God is bound to giue all men this grace: But the very act of beleeuing, they ſay, is not giuen but reſiſtably, leaſt force ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to mans will. They denie therefore that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to giue to any one preciſely &amp; abſolutely faith, and the act of beleeuing. The 4. &amp; laſt decree, they would haue to be that whereby God hath preciſely and abſolutely decreed to ſaue ſome certaine men, for their faith fore-ſeene.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Theſe are the decrees of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and this is the ſumme of their whole doctrine, in the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and viewing of which, the labour is not ſmall, they doe ſo enwrap their meanings, they doe ſo hide
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:11390:67"/>their mindes, that there alwaies lyeth open ſome hole to ſcape by; whoſe meaning he that doth not know, will eaſily beleeue, they haue wrong done them, they doe ſo parget ouer their errour with beautifull co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as if they were of the ſame opinion with vs, when they are very farre diſtant from vs: Then alſo if one in expounding their opinion, hath not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all, euen their leaſt diſtinctions, or hath not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all their ſhifts, it cannot be ſaid, what tragedies they ſtirre vp, how miſerably they complaine, as it were, of force and grieuous ſlanders, and calumny: Being ready alſo to forſweare <hi>Arminius,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to pluck vp their owne opinions, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the cauſe of the Papiſts, finally, to doe any thing ſo they may eſcape our hands.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. But we handle the matter more plainely, nor doe we ſo laboriouſly, cut the election of God into members: Neither doe wee preſcribe an order to God, by which hee ſhould haue digeſted, or yet ought to digeſt his thoughts, and to diſpoſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. We acknowledge there is no generall election, ſeeing there is no election where nothing is left: And we acknowledge no election, vnleſſe it be of ſeuerall and particular perſons, and that alſo to be preciſe and determined by the purpoſe of God; neither doe we thinke any to be elected, but he that ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and infallibly come to ſaluation: Nor doe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that we be elected from faith, or for faith, but vnto faith. For God doth not elect thoſe that are good, by any goodneſſe which goeth before election, but by his election hee will make them good: Nor doth he fore-know any good in vs, but what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:11390:68"/>is to bring to paſſe; which is not to fore-ſee, but fore-ordaine: Neither doe wee make the election of perticular perſons, to depend vpon mans will: Yea, and we beleeue, that perſeuerance, and the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans will in faith doth proceede from Gods free election of grace, by which he decreed to giue to them whom he appointed to an end, the meanes to come to that end.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Wee agree with the <hi>Arminians</hi> in this, that God, in electing, doth conſider a man, not onely as fallen, but as one that by his gift is to beleeue: for thoſe which he appointed to ſaluation, he appointed alſo to faith and repentance; but we doe not thinke, that in election, faith is conſidered as accompliſhed; but as that which ſhould be accompliſhed by the grace of God, and which is the effect of our election; and that God doth this not by compelling the will, but by bowing it, and by granting that of its owne accord it ſhould follow him, calling: Not by a force, which is therefore called irreſiſtable, becauſe thou canſt not reſiſt it although thou wouldſt, ſeeing this very thing is a part of this grace, that thou ſhalt not be willing to reſiſt it: But that God is bound to giue his grace to men, we deteſt it, as an opinion contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, &amp; reproachfull, againſt the mareſty of God. Alſo we deſpiſe the opinion of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> wherby they determine that God equally deſires ſaluation to all, as an opinion contrary to the Scripture &amp; to experience.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Wee ſay that election is the eternall, and therefore immutable decree of God, whereby out of mankind fallen &amp; corrupted, God decreed of his owne meere grace, by Chriſt, to ſaue ſome certaine men,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:11390:68"/>and to giue them the meanes whereby they might come to ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The decree of giuing faith &amp; repentance, we make to be a part of that decree: For the decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the end, includes, alſo the meanes; ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of making warre, doth include, Horſes, Armes, and prouiſion; and the will whereby any one hath decreed to builde, doth neceſſarily include the will of gathering together ſtones and timber: Neither doe we thinke it ſafe to pull aſunder the counſels of God, and as it were, ſcrupulouſly to cut them into peeces.</p>

                  <hi>reſt on that former fore-knowledge.</hi> Truely he is blinde that doth not ſee that it is one thing to follow one, &amp; another thing to reſt on him: For if the riſing ſtarre doth in order goe before the following ſtarre, doth therefore the latter reſt on the former? <hi>Arminius</hi> therefore doth not lay downe faith onely as an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent thing, but as ſomething which doth ſuſtaine election, in which it is founded, and on which electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth reſt: And he doth no leſſe make election de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon faith; who ſaith, that faith is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then he that ſaith that it is the cauſe of Election: for the cauſe giueth to election that it ſhould be, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation giueth to it, that it ſhould ſtand and be firme: Either way alike iniury is done to God, whether you ſay, that ſome vertue which is in man, is the cauſe of the good pleaſure of God; or whether you ſay that the good pleaſure of God hath his foundation from ſome vertue of man.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But by thoſe words, they doe not obſeurely acknowledge, that fore-ſeene faith is the cauſe of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for they will haue the fore-ſeeing of faith ſo to goe before election, as the fore-ſeeing of incredulity,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:11390:69"/>doth in order goe before reprobation: But that the reprobates are appointed to condemnation, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity, and becauſe they are vnbeleeuers, they eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where acknowledge. And <hi>Arminius</hi> againſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins. p.</hi> 86. doth roundly affirme, that ſinne is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of reprobation. So <hi>Arnoldus, p.</hi> 151. <hi>Election and reprobation of particular perſons were made in reſpect of the fore-ſight of faith and incredulity. Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;</hi> Can any ſuſpect your fidelity, that you take the word, <hi>ex,</hi> equiuocally, in reprobation, to note the cauſe, but in election to note the condition? It muſt needes be therefore, that they acknowledge that the elect are appointed to ſaluation for faith fore ſeene, becauſe they beleeue, and that fore-ſeene faith is the cauſe of the election of particular perſons.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But there is no difference, whether you ſay that Election doth reſt on faith fore-ſeene, or that it doth reſt on the fore-ſeeing of faith: for both wares faith is made the cauſe of election, in the latter it is made the neereſt cauſe, in the former it is made the remote cauſe: for fore-ſeene faith is made the cauſe of fore-ſeeing it, and the fore-ſeeing it, is made the cauſe of election: For why doth God fore-know that they will beleeue, vnleſſe becauſe they will beleeue? and why doth he elect, vnleſſe becauſe he fore-knoweth they will beleeue? Theſe are the words of <hi>Arminius</hi> againſt <hi>Perkins. p.</hi> 142. <hi>In that God fore-knowes, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fore-knowes, becauſe it will afterward be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The ſame men a little after, againſt the <hi>Walachri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> doe vſe (although fearefully) the word <hi>depending,</hi> that they might make election depending on faith: <hi>And although</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that word of depending, which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11390:70"/>we are neuer wont to vſe in this argument, be</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>eaſily ſubiect to calumny, yet if a maleuolent minde be abſent, it cannot be drawne to the leaſt ſuſpicion of any abſurdity.</hi> Yes, it may be drawne to the greateſt: For <hi>Greuincho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> himſelfe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 198.</note> doth acknowledge, that dependency, ſtrictly taken, doth argue cauſality, and the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of a ſuperiour by an inferiour. And truely theſe men doe not obſcurely declare how willingly they would vſe this word, if they did not feare our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. There is extant a Treatiſe of <hi>Greuinchouius,</hi> with this Title, <hi>Of election</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">ex.</note> 
                  <hi>for faith fore ſeene:</hi> but that word, <hi>ex,</hi> from, or for, doth not onely note priority, but alſo cauſality: For who would endure a man that ſhould ſay, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> was from <hi>Octauius Auguſtus?</hi> or that this yeare is from the former, becauſe one went before the other? A man that is not vnskiifull of the Latine, doth ſufficiently know, that the praepoſition <hi>ex,</hi> is not fit to note onely the priority of faith, vnleſſe beſides the priority, there is alſo ſome efficiency or dependency: Wherefore the ſame man, <hi>page</hi> 24. hath theſe words: <hi>It is altogether conuenient to the nature of lawes and preſcribed conditions, that the will of the Iudge ſhould be moued to giue the reward, by the required and performed condition.</hi> This performed condition, the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay to be faith, which (if we beleeue them) is conſidered in election, as performed: They will therefore haue God to be moued by this fulfilled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he ſhould giue the reward; which if it be true, faith is plainely the cauſe, both of decreeing and giuing the reward, becauſe it is that which moueth the Iudge.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:11390:70"/>
               <p n="7">VII. So in the conference at the <hi>Hage,</hi> the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> doe contend, that God doth not elect without reſpect of qualities; which thing is true, not onely of faith, but alſo of repentance, ſo it be taken thus; that God in electing, conſidered men, as they that by his gift and bounty would beleeue and be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in repentance. If you take this reſpecting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it muſt needes be, that this reſpecting is the cauſe; for one is ſaid to chooſe any thing in reſpect of ſome quality or vertue, who by that qualitie or vertue, is moued to chooſe it, otherwiſe he would not.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Nay what? That the <hi>Arminian</hi> conferrers at the <hi>Hage, p.</hi> 86. doe vſe the word <hi>Cauſe? (God ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his word whether it ſeemeth good to him, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any abſolute decree, but for other cauſes lying hid in man:</hi> Then is man the cauſe why hee is called: whence it comes, that he is the cauſe alſo that he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. For that which is the cauſe, why God doth call a man to ſaluation, is plainely the cauſe why God will ſaue him; for theſe are things connexed and knit together. The ſame men, page 109. <hi>It is abſurd to put the abſolute will of God in the decree of election, for the firſt and principall cauſe, that it ſhould goe before the other cauſes,</hi> to wit, <hi>Chriſt, faith, and all other cauſes.</hi> Here you heare that faith is put among the cauſes of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: wherefore <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> page, 53. doth leaue it in the middle, whether faith ought to be called the cauſe, or the condition; <hi>Whether</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>faith ſhould be called the condition, or whether it ſhould be called the cauſe, it alwayes being laid downe for granted, that it is the gift of God, this alone is the queſtion, how faith hath reſpect to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11390:71"/>election.</hi> And a little before he had ſaid, <hi>If any ſhould ſay, that in the decree of election, faith hath the reſpect of a cauſe, yet he ſhould not thereby deny that it is the gift of God:</hi> Not obſcurely inſinuating how prone hee was to that part, and perceiued that hee was not raſhly to be blamed, who hath called faith the cauſe of our election.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Adde to theſe that <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> page 186. and the reſt with him, doe contend, that faith is not of thoſe that are elected, but that the election is of thoſe that are faithfull. We truely out of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> chap. 1. <hi>v:</hi> 1. ſay, that faith is of the elect, which we ſo take, becauſe election is the cauſe of faith; to which our aſſertion, ſeeing they oppoſe theirs as contrary, whereby they ſay that election is of them that are faithfull; what elſe would they, but haue faith to be the cauſe of our election?</p>
               <p n="10">X. Let alſo the moment and force of their reaſons be weighed and conſidered. In the conference at the <hi>Hage,</hi> they profeſſe, that they doe not refuſe to write with great letters, and to ſubſcribe, that election is made by Chriſt, without any conſideration of good workes: And yet doe the ſame men, euen to loathing, beate vpon this, that Election is the decree of ſauing them that beleeue; that there is no man elected by God, but in reſpect of faith. But I would know, why they ſo earneſtly exclude the conſideration of workes from election, ſeeing that the earneſt endeauour of good workes is a condition no leſſe fore-required to ſaluation, then faith? Who by theſe things doth not ſee, that faith is not laid downe by them, meerely as a fore-required condition? For if faith were thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:11390:71"/>by them; it is plaine, that the ſtudy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour of good workes, had beene ioyned and placed in the ſame degree with faith.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. And if God electeth to ſaluation, not thoſe whom he abſolutely decreed, but thoſe whom hee fore-ſaw would beleeue; it is plaine that God in electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath reſpect to ſome dignity and worth which is in theſe, but not in them: But it is not likely, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe man doth chooſe the beſt men, for any other cauſe, then becauſe they are the beſt: For if the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the faithfull doe goe before election, hee ſhould doe very ill that ſhould elect them for any other cauſe, then becauſe they are good.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. And certainely, whenſoeuer any thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to a man, vnder a condition, which is in the power of mans free-will; it is plaine, that the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the condition by mans free-will, is the cauſe why the promiſe is fulfilled; and the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe contend, that God doth giue, yea, and that hee is bound to giue grace and ſufficient power to beleeue: but to vſe that grace, or not to vſe it, is in the power of mans free-will.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Neither is it a hard thing to draw from them that which I would haue. For let the Schoole and followers of <hi>Arminius</hi> tell me, what moued God, by his conſequent will to chooſe <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> rather then <hi>Simon Magus?</hi> why <hi>Gregory</hi> rather then <hi>Iulian?</hi> They haue nothing to anſwer, but that it was done, becauſe God fore-ſaw faith in them, and incredulity in theſe. Therefore although they ſhould get it granted, that by their doctrine, fore-ſeene faith is not made the cauſe why God hath appointed this man to ſaluation;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:11390:72"/>yet they muſt needes confeſſe, that according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> fore-ſeene faith is the cauſe of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the elect and the reprobate, and therefore the cauſe why this man is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other; which ſurely is no other thing, then to be the cauſe of election: For euery election is comparatiue, and doth inferre the reiection of one or more.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. So when they deny, that by the will of God electing, the number of the elect is certaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; it muſt needes be, that they would haue mans will to be the cauſe why the number is ſuch a number, and ſo euery man is the cauſe why hee is of the number of the elect, and therefore alſo the cauſe of his owne election.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Although therefore they would haue this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion remoued from them, yet they will neuer wipe out this blot, by which they are contumelious againſt God, and doe weaken the firmeneſſe and ſtrength of faith: As they which make the eternall election and good pleaſure of God, to depend on mans free-will; &amp; will haue ſaluation to be of him that willeth &amp; of him that runneth; &amp; they doe place ſome worth &amp; vertue in man, which is the cauſe why ſaluation in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſell of God, is appointed to one, rather then to another: Whence it comes, that faith doth ſhake, and ſaluation is vncertaine: as that which although God doth certainely fore-know, yet he doth not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely and infallibly will it; for Election is not an act of the fore-knowledge, but of the will of God, and this will, how can it be certaine, if it doth depend on an vncertaine thing, <hi>to wit,</hi> on mans will? But
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11390:72"/>theſe things by the way; for they ſhall be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly examined in their place.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Whereunto adde thoſe things which we haue ſpoken, Chapter 12. where we haue diſſolued, and vnlooſed the chaine of the foure decrees, in which the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe comprehend the whole doctrine of Election: There we haue ſhewed that the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, by which ſaluation is not decreed to particular perſons, but it is determined, that they ſhall be ſaued, who ſhall beleeue, is not the decree of prouidence nor predeſtination, but is the rule of the Goſpell, which doth preſcribe and ſet downe the way to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This queſtion is put to ſlight, onely by the name of election; for Election cannot be of all men; he doth not chooſe that taketh all: Neither, in the time of the deluge, had <hi>Noah</hi> beene choſen that hee
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:11390:73"/>ſhould liue in the deluge, if no man had periſhed by the flood: He is elected, who is preferred before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the reſt being eyther deſpiſed, or leſſe accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And ſeeing in all the points of faith, wee ought to be wiſe, and taught out of the Scriptures, much more in ſo high an argument, which doth exceede our capacitie. Let therefore the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſhew by what place of Scripture all men are ſaid to be elected, by that election which is oppoſite to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation (for of that it is ſpoken here, and not of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſeuerall men, by the conſequent will of God. Who euer heard it ſaid, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or <hi>Iudas,</hi> did any way belong to the election of God? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> indeede 2. <hi>Epiſt.

               <p n="5">V. That alſo is to be obſerued, that by this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall election, it is not decreed who are to be ſaued; but what manner of men are to be ſaued: and that the <hi>Arminians</hi> draw the ninth chapter to the <hi>Romanes</hi> to proue this; where it is plainely ſpoken of the good pleaſure of God, and his mercy towards ſome ſeuerall and peculiar perſons, whom it ſeemeth good to God to chooſe: For thoſe words, <hi>I will haue mercy on whom I will haue mercy,</hi> ſpeake of ſome certaine men;

               <p n="6">VI. But I would learne of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iudas</hi> or <hi>Pilate;</hi> whether the high prieſts and the Scribes, by the inſtigation and accuſations of whom our Sauiour was crucified, were elected conditionally, and comprehended in that generall election. If they were not comprehended, then that generall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall election which they would haue to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all men: falleth to the ground. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, if <hi>Iudas</hi> and thoſe high prieſts were condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally elected, the decree of God, concerning the crucifying of Chriſt, could not be abſolute, becauſe it was done by men, which were conditionally ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, vnder a condition which they might fulfill: It might therefore haue come to paſſe, that before this wicked deede, they might haue beene conuerted and become faithfull, and ſo had not crucified Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And truely it cannot be ſaid, that <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> were elected to ſaluation, vnder the condition of beleeuing in the death of Chriſt, ſeeing they were appointed to that very thing, that by their increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wickedneſſe, Chriſt might be deliuered to death: but if <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> had beleeued in Chriſt, Chriſt had not beene deliuered to death; and therefore this decree, whereby the <hi>Arminians</hi> will
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:11390:74"/>haue God to haue elected <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> vnder this condition, if they would beleeue in Chriſt, doth infolde a contradiction: For they doe as much, as if they ſhould bring in God, ſpeaking thus: <hi>I appointed to ſaue</hi> Iudas <hi>and</hi> Caiaphas, <hi>if they will beleeue in the death of Chriſt: But if they ſhall beleeue, and ſhall be faithfull, Chriſt ſhould not be deliuered to death, nor be crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo of the foure decrees of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> the two former are contrary one to another: For by the firſt decree, God decreed to vſe the incredulity and perfidiouſneſſe of <hi>Iudas,</hi> to deliuer Chriſt to death: But by the ſecond decree, God elected <hi>Iudas</hi> vnder the condition of faith, in the death of Chriſt: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the former decree, <hi>Iudas</hi> is abſolutely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as an vnbeleeuer and a reprobate, but by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he is conſidered as one conditionally elected. The ſchoole of <hi>Arminius</hi> is painted about with theſe monſters, and Chimeraes, contrary one to another, which would moue laughter, if the church were not troubled by them, and the wiſedome of God expoſed to reproach.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Furthermore, by that generall decree whereby all men are ſaid to be elected vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of faith to be performed,

But it is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:11390:74"/>manifeſt by experience that God doth not miniſter to all men the meanes that are neceſſary to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this condition: For he will not haue his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell preached to all, neither doth he giue the ſpirit of regeneration to all.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Finally, what is to be iudged of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall election, appeares by the conſectaries, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions which are drawne thence; whereof that is the chiefeſt, and farre the worſt, whereby they denie that the number of the elect is certaine, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the will of God, electing; whence it followeth that the election of particular perſons, is not certaine by the will of God: For if it were certaine by the decree of God, that this, or that man, were of the number of the elect, then of ſeuerall perſons ioyned together, the whole ſumme and certaine number would be made vp.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:11390:75"/>of the conference at <hi>Hage,</hi> doe with a vaine interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation expound thoſe words of Chriſt: <hi>Reioyce that your names are written in the booke of life:</hi> For they will not haue theſe words to be taken of election to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but they will haue this to be the ſence of it; Reioyce that according to the preſent ſtate of faith, righteouſneſſe, and obedience, ye are accounted for pious and godly men, yea for the ſonnes of God. O good God, where is modeſty! Here is neyther reaſon nor colour for this. For, to be accounted faithfull by men, is not to haue their names written in heauen: Nor was there any cauſe that the Apoſtle ſhould ſo reioyce, becauſe men thought well of them, ſeeing that often times happeneth to him that is moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; and this had beene much leſſe, then that the diuels did tremble at their voice, and fled from them: which yet Chriſt reckons to be but a ſmall thing, in compariſon of hauing their names written in heauen: Surely that ſpeech, <hi>to be written in heauen,</hi> is referred not to the opinion of men, but to the purpoſe of God: And this phraſe is taken from the Prophets, with whom, that is ſaid to be written before God, which is faſtened and determined by his decree. So, <hi>Eſay</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3. they are ſaid to be <hi>written for life,</hi> who were to be preſerued by the purpoſe of God. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 65.6. <hi>Behold it is written before me, I will not keepe ſilence, but will recompence:</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, it is certaine and determined by mee, to reuenge theſe wicked deedes.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. I am aſhamed of that ſhift, whereby ſome of them ſay, that therefore the names of the Apoſtles are ſaid to be written in heauen, becauſe they were
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11390:76"/>elected to their Apoſtleſhippe: For ſo the name of <hi>Iudas</hi> himſelfe was written in heauen; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he had ſo little cauſe to reioyce, that euen his very Apoſtleſhippe turned to his deſtruction. Then alſo we haue the words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> which are plainely agreeable to theſe, by which he calleth the faithfull, <hi>the firſt begotten, which are written in heauen:</hi> which cannot bee drawne to the election to an office, ſeeing it belongeth to all the faithfull and the elect.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. The queſtion of the booke of life is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and longer queſtion, not belonging to this place. I am not ignorant, that there is a certaine booke of life, which is not the booke of election, but the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of them who profeſſe themſelues to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and are viſibly grafted into the couenant, of which book there is mention, <hi>Eze.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. <hi>ver.</hi> 29. out of which booke, there is no doubt but ſome are blotted.

               <p n="1">I. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chapter 1. verſ. 3.4. hath theſe words, <hi>God hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall bleſsings in heauenly places in Chriſt, according as he hath choſen vs in him, before the foundation of the world.</hi> The Apoſtle doth plainely enough teach, that ſpirituall bleſſings, and therefore faith, are giuen vs according to the eternall election, &amp; as we were elected. Whence it followeth, that election is neceſſarily before theſe bleſſings, both in order and time. So hee that ſaith, that the Souldiers receiued their donatiue and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence, as it ſeemed good to their Generall, doth manifeſtly ſay, that firſt it ſeemed good to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall before it was done, and that the certaine and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute will of the Generall went before this largeſſe and gift. Neither are thoſe words of leſſe moment which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11390:77"/>follow: <hi>He elected vs in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him, in loue.</hi> You ſee that we are elected to holineſſe, and not from holineſſe, or for holineſſe; and if we be elected to holineſſe, then alſo are we elected to faith, wherein our holineſſe chiefly conſiſts. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that faith is a part of our holines, vnleſſe by him, who alſo denieth, that incredulity in the prophane is a part of their prophaneneſſe and vice: For by faith we are not onely ſanctified efficiently, but alſo formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; no otherwiſe then the wall is formally whited by the white colour. And if the <hi>Arminians</hi> could get it granted, that the holineſſe which is ſpoken of here, doth conſiſt onely in charity, yet they would effect nothing, nor would it euer the leſſe be proued out of this place, that we are choſen to faith; for he that is elected to charity, is neceſſarily elected to faith, which begets charity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. Nor is it credible, that any one is elected to one part of holineſſe, and not to the other.</p>
               <p>Being beate therefore from hence, they ſeeke other refuges. <hi>Arnoldus. p.</hi> 66. by <hi>elect,</hi> would haue <hi>they that are called</hi> to be vnderſtood; as if election and calling were the ſame thing: but <hi>many are called, few are choſen, Matth.</hi> 20. Therefore among theſe elect (if <hi>Arnoldus</hi> be beleeued) there will be many reprobates; neither will this election be oppoſed to reprobation. The ſame man, <hi>pag.</hi> 142. doth contend, that theſe <hi>elect</hi> are <hi>the faithfull,</hi> which is falſe in that ſenſe he takes it, <hi>to wit,</hi> that they are conſidered as being already faithfull, when they are elected: For how can they that are conſidered as being faithfull, be elected to holineſſe,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:11390:77"/>ſeeing in that they are faithfull, they are already holy? <hi>Paul</hi> indeede ſpeakes to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> whom hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth faithfull and bleſſed: but not, if now they were faithfull and bleſſed, they were therefore faithfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were elected.</p>
               <p>This good man therefore hath deuiſed another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, and would haue <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeake not of the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of particular perſons, but of the election, whereby any one people is elected to the calling, by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. If this be true, it muſt needes be, that among the elect, before the foundation of the world, there were many reprobates: But the following words doe not admit this interpretation; for the Apoſtle ſaith, we are elected, <hi>that we ſhould be without blame, in loue.</hi> He will haue vs to be elect, that we might endeauour to holineſſe and good workes: Now good workes are of particular men, and not of a Nation; neither by the elect can here be vnderſtood, the nations admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the couenant, ſeeing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> includes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this number, <hi>Hath choſen vs in Chriſt, &amp;c. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus</hi> himſelfe doth ſufficiently declare how little he truſts to this expoſition, while hee ioynes another which ouerthrowes this: He ſaith, that here it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the election to glory, and therefore by <hi>holineſſe,</hi> would haue <hi>ſaluation</hi> vnderſtood: But the Apoſtle doth fitly preuent this ſtarting hole; for hee addes, <hi>that we might be holy and blameleſſe;</hi> but to be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is a vertue, and not ſaluation it ſelfe: Then alſo <hi>Paul</hi> expounds, how wee are holy, <hi>to wit in charity,</hi> nor in the fruition and enioying of glory. He vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the dueties of charity which are exerciſed in this life, vnto which to be exhorted after this life is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11390:78"/>needeleſſe. Finally, by their ſo various and diuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which ouerthrow one another, they doe ſufficiently confeſſe, that they haue nothing wherein they may be conſtant: And becauſe they cannot ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vs by the weight of their expoſitions, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to ouerwhelme vs by the multitude of them.</p>
               <p>It is of ſmall importance, that from this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>blameleſſe,</hi> they gather, that it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the perfection after this life: For the Apoſtle will haue vs to be blameleſſe, euen in this life, as, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> 2.15. Where he commands vs to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>blameleſſe, and harmeleſſe,</hi> in the midſt of a crooked and peruerſe generation. Certainly, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that we might be blameleſſe in charity;</hi> it is manifeſt, that he doth not ſpeake of the Saints en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying glory, where there is no place for reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor for exhortation, to the duties of charitie. There is no little force in the following verſe: <hi>He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated vs to the adoption of children, by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Out of this place I thus reaſon: Thoſe whom God predeſtinated to adoption, he hath predeſtinated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the ſpirit of adoption, to be giuen them, and this is nothing elſe but to predeſtinate them to faith; for the ſpirit of adoption is it that beareth witneſſe in our hearts, that we are the ſonnes of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and this teſtimony is faith it ſelfe. It is true indeede, that God appointeth no man to adoption, but whom God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth, as one that by his gift will be faithfull; but the ſame may alſo be ſaid of thoſe that are appointed to faith, which is appointed to none but whom God conſidereth as one that will be faithfull: And ſurely
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:11390:78"/>they are groſely deceiued, who thinke that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are appointed to the adoption of children, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that they are faithfull, they are already chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: This Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth, chapter 1. <hi>To them that beleeued, he gaue this prerogatiue, to be the ſonnes of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Agreeable to this place are alſo many other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25. <hi>I haue obtained mercy of the Lord to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> not becauſe he conſidered me as already faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.16. <hi>I haue choſen you, that you ſhould bring forth fruit:</hi> therefore he did not chooſe vs, conſidered as already faithfull, and therefore as already bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fruit. Should wee imagine, that Chriſt ſpeakes here onely of the election of the Apoſtles to their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip? I thinke there is none of ſo impudent a face, who can deny that the ſame thing may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of any of the elect, whereof there is none whom God hath not elected, that hee might be godly and good: euen as alſo there is no man, who is not of a ſhameleſſe countenance, who will deny that all the following documents and leſſons, doe belong to all the faithfull: <hi>Theſe things I commend you, that you loue one another: If the world hate you, you know that it hath hated me firſh, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="3">III.

               <p n="4">IV. The words of <hi>Ananias</hi> to S. <hi>Paul, Act</hi> 22.14.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11390:79"/>are conſonant to this; <hi>God hath choſen thee, that thou ſhouldſt know his will;</hi> by which knowledge, faith and aſſent to the Goſpell is vnderſtood: for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was not elected more to know the Goſpell, then to beleeue the Goſpell: <hi>Paul</hi> therefore was elected to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieeue, and ſo his election was before his faith.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The ſame Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 1.3. praiſing the faith and charitie of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> doth fetch the cauſe of theſe vertues from election it ſelfe: <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring without ceaſing your worke of faith, and labour of lone, as knowing that you are elected of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe willingly ſtumble in a plaine way: for by Election they will haue Calling to be vnderſtood; which if it be true, the reprobates themſelues will be elected, as being alſo called. Then alſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is deluded, as if hee were not in his right minde: For what neede <hi>Paul</hi> tell the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> that he knew they were called by the Goſpell, ſeeing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe preached the Goſpell to them? He were a ridiculous Grammarian, who ſhould tell his Schollers that he had taught; <hi>I know you haue learned Grammer. Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 66. doth ſuſpect that the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>knowing,</hi> is to be referred to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi> themſelues. But the good man hath dealt too negligently here, for he doth not ſee, that by this meanes, the Greeke ſpeech would be made incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and not agreeing, for then it muſt haue beene read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that it might agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is in the former verſe. But diſtruſting this expoſition, he hath ſmelt out that by the word <hi>election, excellency</hi> ought to be vnderſtood, which truely is an intollerable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe; ſeeing election differeth from excellency by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11390:79"/>the whole praedicament; for election is an action, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency is a quality, or a relation. Surely if it be lawfull to bring ſuch portents and monſters of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what will there be in the holy Scripture, which may not be deluded or depraued? Let <hi>Arnoldus</hi> bring another place, where Excellency is vnderſtood by the word Election: For although <hi>he that is elected,</hi> may be taken <hi>for him that excelleth,</hi> yet you ſhall neuer finde <hi>Election</hi> to be ſo taken for <hi>Excellency.</hi> Neither ought it to ſeeme a maruaile that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he knew of the election of the <hi>Theſſalonians;</hi> for God might reueile that to him concerning the <hi>Teſſalonians,</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed concerning the <hi>Corinthians, Acts</hi> 18.10. <hi>I haue much people in this citie.</hi> Or if that doth not pleaſe, it may be ſaid, that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaw the Goſpell receiued by the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> with very great ioy and much fruite, eaſily perſwaded himſelfe that many of that people belonged to the election of God.</p>

But the <hi>Arminians</hi> deny this; for they write of the Apoſtaſie of the Saints, and thinke that the moſt holy men may fall away. It remaines therefore, that faith is ſaid to be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:11390:80"/>of the elect, which God giueth to the elect, and which is a fruit of election.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> auoid this dart and argument, by ſaying, that by the name of faith, is vnderſtood do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: But they doe not well auoid it ſo, for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell is not peculiar to the elect, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be called the doctrine of the elect, ſeeing it is preached alſo to wicked and prophane men Here therefore we may ſee the Apoſtle and <hi>Arminius</hi> to be ſtriuing together: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Faith is of the elect:

                  <hi>Armintus</hi> on the contrary part ſaith, that electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of them that are faithfull, and who are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as already beleeuing.</p>
               <p>With like licentious liberty, doe they abuſe the word, <hi>of the elect,</hi> by which they will haue thoſe that are called, and are holy to be vnderſtood: But after what manner?

               <p n="7">VII.

               <p>And if election be not peremptory, &amp; immutable, but after finall perſeuerance, as the <hi>Arminians</hi> would haue it, then we muſt ſay, that the names of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who did then firſt enter the race of Chriſtian profeſſion, were ſo written in Heauen, that yet it was in the power of the Apoſtles to fall away from the faith and ſo to be reprobated; And therefore they could bring it to paſſe, that Chriſt ſhould lie: See to what the audacity of theſe innouators doth come. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, that that is ſaid in the Scripture to be written in Heauen &amp; before God, which is appointed &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by his eternall counſell, we haue proued in the former Chapter; where we haue reiected that vnſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and raſh interpretation of the <hi>Arminians;</hi> we will haue the writing of our names in heauen, to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe then to be accounted the children of God, by the preſent ſtate of righteouſneſſe, and that for no other argument, then becauſe they will haue it ſo.</p>

Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace ye are ſaued through faith:</hi> He doth not ſay, that they are ſaued for faith fore-ſeen, but by faith, as by the meanes to ſaluation: And if God doth not ſaue vs for faith fore ſeen, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil ſaue vs for faith fore-ſeen, nor doth he elect vs for faith fore-ſeen: For to elect, is to be willing to ſaue.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The ſame words, <hi>By grace ye are ſaued through faith,</hi> do plainly ſay, that faith is the meanes to ſaluation: &amp; if ſaluation be the end, and faith the meanes, it muſt needs be that God thoght of giuing ſaluation to <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> before he thoght of giuing them faith, wherby they ſhould come to ſaluation: for the end is firſt in the intent before the means: ſo habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is intended before building, life before foode, health before phiſick. With what face therfore dare the <hi>Armint.</hi> ſay, that God had
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:11390:81"/>decreed to giue <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> faith, before he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to giue them ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="10">X. But here <hi>Arminius</hi> hath laid aſide ſhame, and doth deny that ſaluation is Gods end; but hee ſaith, that ſaluation and faith are the gifts of God, tied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the will of God in this order, that faith ſhould goe before ſaluation, in reſpect of God the giuer, and in the thing it ſelfe. Theſe are the words of <hi>Arminius,</hi> which are cited and allowed by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> in their anſwere to the Epiſtle to the <hi>Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrians. Pag.</hi> 93. But beſides that, I had rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> teaching that we are ſaued by God, through faith. <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe doth ſeeme to me to grant the ſame thing, while he doth deny it: For it is not likely, that God is willing, that faith ſhould goe before the obtaining of ſaluation, vnleſſe becauſe he will giue and beſtow ſaith vnto ſaluation. Now that which helpeth to obtaine ſaluation, is the meanes by which we come to ſaluation, as to the end. <hi>Greuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chouius</hi> following him, <hi>Pag.</hi> 12. doth deny that God intended the ſaluation of certaine men in particular, as an end. And <hi>Pag.</hi> 124. <hi>We haue ſaid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that faith is to be conſidered two manner of waies, eyther as it is preſcribed and to be performed, or as it is already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: As it is to be performed, it is not the meanes, but the condition, and the thing required: But as it is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it is the meanes to man, by which he doth obtaine ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, promiſed vnder the condition of faith.</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall obſerue his excellent wit. This man will haue faith, then, to be the meanes to ſaluation, when it is performed, <hi>that is,</hi> when faith ceaſeth: For the <hi>Arminians</hi> then thinke faith to be performed, when
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:11390:81"/>one hath perſeuered in faith to the end; at which time viſion and ſight ſucceedeth to faith ceaſing. Therefore (if <hi>Arminius</hi> be beleeued) ſaith will then beginne to be the meanes of ſaluation, when it is not faith: Then alſo that ſaying, that faith performed, is the meanes for man, not for God, is very weake: For faith is the meanes for a man to come to ſaluation, for no other cauſe, then becauſe God willeth and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that man ſhould come to ſaluation by faith: So he that ſaith, that foode is the meanes for a man to liue, ſaith alſo that it is the meanes that God doth vſe for the ſuſtentation of mans life.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. It is of no ſmall importance that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the ſame place, calleth faith the gift of God: <hi>By grace ye are ſaued through faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and that not of your ſelues, it is the gift of God:</hi> For the Apoſtle will not haue ſaluation alone to be the gift of God, but alſo faith: For he that giueth the end, giueth alſo the meanes; as hee that giues vs life, giues vs alſo meanes to maintaine our life. So <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.19. <hi>It is giuen to you for Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>in that which concerneth Chriſt, not onely to beleeue on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake:</hi> Therefore to beleeue in Chriſt, is the gift of God. Wherefore we are not rightly ſaid to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by God for faith fore-ſeene, ſeeing God himſelfe giues faith: For God is not ſaid (vnleſſe it be very vnproperly) to fore-ſee thoſe things which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe determined to doe. Hee would not be thought to haue a ſound braine, who ſhould ſay that God fore-ſaw the Sunne would be round or ſhining, for God himſelfe turned it into roundneſſe, and put the light into it. How greatly the <hi>Arminians</hi> erre here,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:11390:82"/>and that it followes of their doctrine, that faith is not the gift of God, although ſometimes they ſpeake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſhall be ſeene in the right place.</p>

This inclination muſt be to doe ſomething, and not to enioy or obtaine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:11390:83"/>So one may be ſaid, to be inclined to the exerciſe of his body, but not to health; to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, not to the reward or victory: Or if any one pleaſe to take the word <hi>diſpoſitum, diſpoſed,</hi> for <hi>cupido, deſire,</hi> there is no man who is not diſpoſed to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p>It is not for nothing, that the Greeke hath not the word, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>It is to no purpoſe, that they therefore gather, that by <hi>thoſe that are ordained,</hi> are vnderſtood, <hi>thoſe that are diſpoſed,</hi> becauſe in that place, they are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them that are vnworthy. For <hi>Luke</hi> here makes no oppoſition, nor if he did, would it any thing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs, who know that by the very election to faith and ſaluation, men are made worthy, and therefore alſo we are oppoſed to thoſe that are vnworthy.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:11390:83"/>that which is the cauſe of perſeuerance in faith, is the cauſe of faith. That which is the cauſe why one doth alwaies beleeue, is the cauſe why hee doth beleeue: Therefore the opinion of <hi>Arminius</hi> doth fall to the ground, by which he determineth, that not onely faith, but alſo perſeuerance in faith, is before election. and that God in electing doth conſider it as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already performed and fulfilled.</p>

But if God hath not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected vs for the foreſeeing of workes; then certainly, not for the fore-ſeeing of faith, which doth beget and effect workes: And if God hath not elected any one for the fore-ſeeing of faith, then certainely, not for the right vſing of grace, nor for the obedience of faith, for as much as this vſing and this obedience, is manifeſtly a worke: Neither is it any doubt, but that to embrace the Goſpell by faith, is a kinde of worke and action of the will.</p>

                  <hi>Election for faith fore-ſeene is confuted by places taken out of the Goſpell of Saint</hi> Iohn.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His contention will ceaſe, if we ſtand to the teſtimony of Chriſt himſelfe; in the Goſpell according to Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> hee faith many things which cut this knot, and leaue no place for doubting.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6 37. he thus ſpeaketh to the Iewes, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer my father giueth me, ſhall come to me:</hi> To come to Chriſt, is to beleeue; for ſo Chriſt himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, verſe 35. <hi>He that commeth to me, ſhall not hunger, and he that beleeueth in me ſhall neuer thirſt:</hi> He might haue ſaid in both places; Hee that commeth ſhall not hunger, nor ſhall thirſt; but in the latter place he puts <hi>beleeue,</hi> for <hi>come,</hi> that wee might know that we come to Chriſt by beleeuing. The meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Chriſt is, that thoſe that are giuen him by the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:11390:85"/>father, will beleeue in him.; and they are giuen to the ſonne, who are therefore giuen, that hee might ſaue them, and they might be his flocke. The ſenſe therefore of theſe words, <hi>whatſoeuer my father giueth to me, ſhall come,</hi> is this, <hi>Whoſoeuer my father giueth me to be ſaued, ſhall beleeue in me.</hi> They are giuen then to Chriſt, before they can come, or can beleeue; for therefore they come to Chriſt, and beleeue, becauſe they are giuen him. But <hi>Arminius</hi> will haue them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue before they be giuen, for he will haue them to be elected, and therefore to be giuen to Chriſt for faith fore-ſeene. Chriſt ſaith that therefore they come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are giuen him: the ſectaries on the contrary ſay, that therefore they are giuen, becauſe they come.</p>
               <p>In another place, the head-ſtrong obſtinacy of theſe men, doth no leſſe diſcouer it ſelfe, by them <hi>who are giuen to Chriſt;</hi> they would haue the faithfull to be vnderſtood, as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>he that beleeueth in me will come to me.</hi> But we haue already proued, that to come, is the ſame that it is to beleeue. The ſence therefore of theſe words of Chriſt, according to <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> will be this; <hi>Whoſoeuer doth beleeue, ſhall beleeue in me:</hi> Adde to theſe, that ſeeing in the <hi>Arminian</hi> election, faith and perſeuerance in faith is conſidered as already performed, and therefore they that are elected, are conſidered as dead, or in the very limits of life and death; they cannot be ſaid to come, who haue not already meaſured out the courſe of their life. Neither by them who are giuen to Chriſt, can be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood thoſe which firſt gaue themſelues to Chriſt; for this were not to giue themſelues to the ſonne, but to be willing that the ſonne ſhould receiue them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:11390:86"/>to him. He indeede receiueth thoſe that come, but they therfore come, becauſe Chriſt draweth them; as he himſelfe ſaith, verſe 44. <hi>No man can come to me, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the father, that ſent me, draw him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Arminian</hi> conferrers at the <hi>Hage, pag.</hi> 87. doe ſuſpect, that by thoſe <hi>that are giuen to the ſonne,</hi> are to be vnderſtood, not <hi>the faithfull,</hi> but thoſe <hi>that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to beleeue.</hi> But ſeeing the <hi>Arminians</hi> are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the reprobates alſo are giuen to beleeue, and that God doth ſeriouſly intend their faith and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, they ſhould be falſely ſaid, that they were to come to Chriſt, <hi>that is,</hi> that they wil beleeue, as many as are giuen him to beleeue. The very words of Chriſt doe affirme, and common ſenſe doe conuince this, that by thoſe that are giuen to Chriſt, are vnderſtood his flocke, and therefore the elect: for as much as thoſe that are giuen to Chriſt, are here ſeuered from thoſe that are not giuen.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.47. <hi>Ye therefore heare not, becauſe ye are not of God:</hi> They therefore which heare and beleeue, doe therefore heare and beleeue, becauſe they are of God; and to be of God, what is it elſe, then to belong to God? As on the contrary part, <hi>verſe</hi> 44. they are ſaid to be of the diuell, who belong to the diuell. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that Chriſt himſelfe doth witneſſe, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome men beleeue, becauſe they belong to God; who doth not ſee, that it muſt needes be, that they firſt belong to God, before they beleeue, for as much as to belong to God, is the cauſe why they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue?</p>
               <p n="3">III. Nor is there leſſe force in the words of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.26. <hi>Yee beleeue not, becauſe yee are not of my
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:11390:86"/>ſheepe:</hi> They then who beleeue, doe therefore beleeue, becauſe they are of the ſheepe of Chriſt: Not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Arminius,</hi> who would therefore haue them to be of the ſheepe of Chriſt, becauſe they beleeue. It pleaſeth the <hi>Arminians</hi> to haue the faithfull vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the ſheepe of Chriſt, and I doe not deny, but that the ſheepe of Chriſt, are they which beleeue; but I deny that the word <hi>ſheepe,</hi> can be ſo taken in this place: For ſo an vnſauory tantalogy and vaine repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition ſhould be put vpon Chriſt; <hi>ye beleeue not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye beleeue not.</hi> This is a declaration of it, that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he called thoſe alſo his ſheepe, which were not yet conuerted: <hi>Other ſheepe I haue, which are not of this fould, them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall heare my voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. So, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.6. <hi>I haue manifeſted thy name vnto them which thou gaueſt me:</hi> Therefore firſt they were giuen, before Chriſt declared to them the name of God, by which declaration they receiued faith. The <hi>Arminian</hi> conferrers at the <hi>Hage, pag.</hi> 87. thinke that it is here ſpoken of the Apoſtles, who did already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue; but they proue nothing by it: for this being granted, yet that ſtands which I maintaine, that the Apoſtles were firſt giuen to Chriſt, before he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelfe to them. But that it is not here ſpoke of the Apoſtles alone, Chriſt himſelfe doth expreſly witneſſe, verſe 20. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall beleeue on me, through their word.</hi> And ſeeing that <hi>ver.</hi> 9. they are oppoſed to the world, it appeares that theſe things are to be extended to all the faithfull: Vnleſſe, perhaps the Schoole and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Arminius,</hi> doe thinke that the Apoſtles
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:11390:87"/>alone are they that are not of the world, and that they alone are exempted from the curſe of the world. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, ſeeing there is no part of the Scripture which doth bring more comfort, nor doth more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our faith, ſtriuing with temptations, then this diuine and large prayer of Chriſt, becauſe the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt, making interceſſion for vs, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſecret promiſes and declarations of the good will of the father, which doth alwaies agree with the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſonne; let the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſee with what ſpirit they are led, and why with ſo great diligence they endeauour to defraud vs of that comfort, which is certainely taken from vs, if this Prayer of Chriſt doth intercede for the Apoſtles alone; and if the Apoſtles onely be meant by thoſe that are giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Paul</hi> in the eight to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Predeſtination, doth eaſily driue away all the cloudes of errour. His words are theſe, Verſe 28.29.30. <hi>We know that all things worke together for good to them that loue God, to them that are called, according to his purpoſe: For whom he did fore-know, them alſo he did predeſtinate to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the image of his Sonne, that he might be firſt borne among many brethren. Moreouer, whom he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, them alſo he called, and whom he called them alſo he iuſtified, and whom he iuſtified, them alſo he glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:11390:87"/>
               <p n="1">I. Firſt of all, that ſpeech offers it ſelfe, that we are predeſtinated, that we might be made conformable to the image of Chriſt: And ſeeing this conformity in this life, is by faith and charity; it is plaine by the Apoſtle, that wee are iuſtified to faith, and not for faith. I know indeede that Chriſt himſelfe had not faith, as faith is taken in the Goſpell; but ſeeing that the conformity of the faithfull with Chriſt is placed in charity, righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe; and theſe are the effects of faith, which doth worke by charity: he that ſaith we are predeſtinated to charity and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, doth alſo ſay, that we are predeſtinated to faith, which doth effect and worke all thoſe things; no otherwiſe then hee who is appointed to goe and to breath, is appointed alſo to life.</p>
               <p n="2">II. What ſay the <hi>Arminians</hi> here? Why, they by conformity with Chriſt, vnderſtand the croſſe, and afflictions for Chriſt: But the following words diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue that, <hi>that he might be firſt borne among many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> For Chriſt is the firſt begotten of the ſonnes of God; as for other cauſes, ſo alſo becauſe hee being more liberally furniſhed with the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, is an example of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe; <hi>being annointed with the oyle of gladneſſe aboue his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, Pſal.</hi> 45. euen as the firſt borne receiue more of their fathers goods: But that he ſhould be called the firſt borne for the croſſe and for afflictions, is a thing new and inſolent, and that which reaſon abhorreth. Alſo it is certaine, that that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, doth belong to all the faithfull. For he addeth, <hi>whom he did predeſtinate, them alſo be called, whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, them alſo he iuſtified, whom he iuſtified, them alſo he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:11390:88"/>glorified.</hi> Glorification, iuſtification, calling, prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, are the foure linkes of that chaine belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the conformity vnto the image of Chriſt, and they are ſo interlaced &amp; enfolded, that by no meanes they can be pulled aſunder: For all that are glorified are iuſtified, all that are iuſtified are called by that effectuall calling, which is peculiar to the elect; all that are ſo called are appointed, that they ſhould be conformable to the image of Chriſt. Let the ſectaries tell me, whether glorification, iuſtification, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, doe not belong to all the elect: For <hi>Arminius,</hi> while he doth reſtraine this conformity to afflictions, he maketh many elect, that are not conformable to Chriſt, becauſe many of the ſeruants of God, euen of the beſt, haue had peace without interruption, and quietneſſe with honour. Doe the <hi>Arminians</hi> wipe themſelues out of the number of the elect, who in the height of peace, forgetfull of the croſſe of Chriſt, haue moued this ſinke, pernicious and deadly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and to the Church? I am not ignorant, that theſe things are ſpoken by the Apoſtle, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the afflicted, to whom all things turne to good. But what lets, that hee ſhould not comfort them by thoſe leſſons which might belong to all. So the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. when hee had commanded ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to be ſubiect to their maſters, not onely if they were good, but alſo if they were euill and rough; a little after he doth exhort them to patience, by thoſe inſtructions which are common to all Chriſtians, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing them that it is pleaſing to God, if any of them endure troubles for conſcience ſake; that Chriſt being innocent, therfore ſuffered, that he might leaue
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:11390:88"/>vs an example, that we might walke in his ſteppes: And it is no doubt, but that theſe that are here ſaid to be predeſtinated to conformity, vnto the image of Chriſt, are the ſame with thoſe, who in the ſame place he ſaith, are called by the purpoſe of God: But they that are afflicted for Chriſt, are not onely called, but alſo all the elect; among whom there are many that are free from perſecutions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Eſpecially obſerue, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here doth ſpeake of the election of particular perſons, <hi>thoſe whom he Predeſtinated,</hi> and <hi>thoſe whom he glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> for but ſome, and that a few are glorified. Theſe Innouators, will haue the election of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be after calling and they will haue them to be elected, whom God fore-ſeeth will follow him cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and they make election to reſt vpon this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here maketh election to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling, when hee ſaith, <hi>Whom he predeſtinated them alſo he called, whom he called, them alſo he iuſtified; whom he iuſtified, them alſo he glorified:</hi> For as in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and time, iuſtification is before glorification; and calling before iuſtification, ſo alſo the predeſtination of ſeuerall perſons is before calling.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But it is worth the labour, to conſider the linkes of that Apoſtolicall chaine, <hi>Whom he prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated he called, whom he called he iuſtified, whom he iuſtified he glorified,</hi> Doe not you ſee how we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to our calling, and by our calling to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? And ſeeing that we are iuſtified by Faith, it followeth that we are predeſtinated to Faith: For how can he be predeſtinated to iuſtification by Faith, who is not predeſtinated to Faith? Theſe things ſtrike at the life.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:11390:89"/>
               <p n="5">V. I let paſſe, that the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe ouerturne thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul, whom he iuſtified, them alſo he glorified;</hi> while they affirme, that many are iuſtified who are reprobates. This they cleerely ſhew in their Epiſtle againſt the <hi>Walachrians, Pag</hi> 40. <hi>They who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue for a time, may be ſaid to be iuſtified, whom the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent doth ſhew to be reprobates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. In the ſame chapter, v. 16. he ſaith, <hi>The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God.</hi> I demande whether this teſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſpirit be certaine or doubtfull? If it be doubtfull, the ſpirit of God is accuſed of a lie. If it be certaine, I demand on what foundation doth this certainty reſt? Doth it reſt on the power of free-will? Why this is a doubtfull and deceitfull certainty. Or is this teſtimony certaine, becauſe it is giuen to none but them, whom God hath certainely appointed to ſaluation? Why, this is that very thing, which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and the <hi>Arminians</hi> deny.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. There is no leſſe force in the ninth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> where the Apoſtle doth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and largely treate of Election and reprobation. The ſcope of the Apoſtle, is to teach, that election and ſaluation, is not of the workes of the law, but of God, calling and hauing mercy, and his ſcope is not (as <hi>Arminius</hi> faines) to treate of iuſtification by faith. I will not repeate thoſe things which are ſpoken, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. where we hauer preſſed <hi>Arminius,</hi> torturing the Apoſtle, that he might draw him, againſt his will, to the patronage of his cauſe.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Thus much the carefull Reader ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue; that <hi>Paul</hi> after he hath ſpoken of the purpoſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:11390:89"/>of God, according to Election, doth preſently lay downe <hi>Iacob,</hi> for an example of that Election; whom God loued before he had done any good or euil, and therefore before he had beleeued (for to beleeue, is to doe ſomething) and ſo Election went before Faith. Yea, although to beleeue the Goſpell and obey it, were not an action; yet if election went before the conſideration of workes, it muſt needes alſo goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſideration of Faith, from which workes doe flow: For if Faith ſhould goe before Election, God in electing could not conſider Faith, but as bringing forth workes, for otherwiſe he had conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Faith, not as it is, but as it is not.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Alſo that which he ſaith, v. 16. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> were falſe, if God had mercy on men for faith fore-ſcene. For the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe hold this ſtedfaſtly, and defend with greateſt diligence; that God giueth all men power of beleeuing in Chriſt, yea, and that he is bound to giue it, and how great grace ſoeuer God may giue to beleeue in act, yet it is in the power of mans free will to vſe this grace or not to vſe it; to beleeue or not to beleeue, and that that man is elected by God, whom he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw would beleeue, and whom he conſidereth as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beleeuing. According to this doctrine, it may rightly be ſaid, that ſaluation is of him that willeth and of him that runneth, and not onely of God that ſheweth mercy: But if <hi>Paul</hi> therefore ſaid, that it is not of him that willeth, becauſe it is not alone of him that wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leth, why ſhall it not be alſo lawfull to ſay, that it is not of God that ſheweth mercy, becauſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:11390:90"/>it is not alone of him ſhewing mercy, but alſo of mans free will.</p>
               <p n="10">X. But if to that queſtion whereby it is demanded, why God of one and the ſame Maſſe, hath loued one and hated another, why hee had mercy of one, and hardned the other; it may be anſwered, that it was done becauſe God fore-ſaw that the one would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and the other would not beleeue: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ought not to haue blamed the demander, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be ſilent, ſeeing the cauſe of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is in readineſſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> in the one, faith was fore-ſeene, in the other vnbeleefe was foreſeene. Did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeeme to <hi>Arminius,</hi> eyther not to be quick of vnderſtanding, or to be ſcrupulous without cauſe? But leaſt he ſhould be compelled to ſay this, he hath deuiſed I know not what ſubtilties, and monſters of interpretations: Such as are theſe. <hi>Of him that calleth,</hi> that is, <hi>of Faith:</hi> And <hi>of God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy,</hi> that is, <hi>that iuſtifieth not for workes, but for Faith,</hi> which mercy, notwithſtanding is common to many reprobates. Then alſo that ſpeech, <hi>I will haue mercy on whom I will haue mercy,</hi> by <hi>cuius, whom,</hi> hee would haue <hi>qualium, what ſort of men,</hi> to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And <hi>it is not of him that willeth,</hi> to wit, <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> is not: For he denyeth that theſe are to be vnderſtood of ſaluation, as if ſaluation were of him that willeth: Euen as <hi>to haue mercy,</hi> if <hi>Arminius</hi> be beleeued, is not to <hi>ſaue,</hi> but to giue the meanes to righteouſneſſe, And many more ſuch like, which are eyther inconuenient or wreſted, which we haue exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the 15. chapter.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Adde to theſe that which is in the eleuenth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:11390:90"/>to the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.5.</note> 
                  <hi>At this preſent there is a remnant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the election of Grace.</hi> By this remnant, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued portion, are vnderſtood thoſe Iewes who clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to Chriſt, and who did not fall from the couenant with the reſt. We haue here therefore the cauſe why theſe perſeuered in the Faith, and haue not fallen from grace, <hi>to wit,</hi> becauſe the reſeruation was made according to the election of grace: Therefore perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in Faith, is according to the election of grace, and not election, according to perſeuerance in Faith. as <hi>Arminius</hi> would haue it. <hi>Arminius,</hi> that he might ſhift off this place, ſaith, that it is here ſpoken of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to righteouſneſſe, not of election to Faith, which although it be falſe, yet it doth not infringe the force and euidence of this place: For, whoſoeuer is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to righteouſneſſe, is elected to Faith. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I cannot ſufficiently maruaile at that which <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pag.</hi> 222. <hi>What is that which is by grace?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Armin. in Perk. pag.</hi> 222.</note> 
                  <hi>It is election to Faith, nothing leſſe, but it is election to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> as if there were any righteouſneſſe without Faith: Or as if he who refuſeth Faith, doth not alſo refuſe righteouſneſſe. Surely theſe things ſound of Socianiſme, and doe ſhew that there is vnder them ſome hidden vlcer: Alſo what is it to the purpoſe to contend, that it is here ſpoken of election to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, ſeeing according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> this is not certaine by the will of God, but doth depend on mans free-will.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>Arnoldus, Pag.</hi> 346. dealeth more warily: He thinks that it is ſpoken here of the reiection of the Iewes, and taking in of the Gentiles: But the word remnant, or reſeruation, doth confute this, for from
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:11390:91"/>hence, as alſo from the former verſes, it is manifeſt that he doth enquire the cauſe, why a few of the Iewes, onely a remnant, doe belong to the couenant, being afterwards to explaine how the Gentiles were engrafted into the place of the reſt, which were reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and cut off.</p>
               <p>Finally, againſt theſe places of Scripture, the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> (although they be acute and witty men) doe ſo flye the encounter, they doe fight ſo recoylingly, they doe ſo intangle themſelues, that they ſeeme ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be vnwilling to be vnderſtood, or to diſtruſt their owne cauſe: Furthermore, if they ſay true, no man yet had vnderſtood what Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is.</p>

               <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eaſon it ſelfe doth agree to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For if perſeuerance in Faith, be conſidered in Election, as a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready performed, no man is elected but he is conſidered as dead, and as hauing finiſhed his courſe, for no man can be ſaid to haue perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vntill the end, but hee which is come vnto the end.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Hence alſo it appeareth, that <hi>Arminius</hi> is contrary to himſelfe; For hee ſaith, Election is of them that beleeue: But they that are dead ceaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: Therefore, that <hi>Arminius</hi> might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to himſelfe, hee ought to ſay, that Election is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:11390:91"/>of them that ceaſe to beleeue, and not of them that beleeue.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Alſo if election to glory, be made for ſome fore-ſeene vertue, Chriſt himſelfe, as hee was man, was not predeſtinated to glory: for he was not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to ſuch a height of glory, for the fore-ſeeing ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of faith, or workes, or any vertue; for whatſoeuer vertue or holineſſe is in Chriſt, as he is man, doth flow from the perſonall vnion with the diuinity, and from the purity of his conception, by which he was free from originall ſinne. Therefore this his holineſſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be fore-ſeene, but to be decreed. Nor was he predeſtinated for holineſſe, but to holineſſe. And that the election of the head, ſhould be contrary to the election of the members, and that the head ſhould be elected to vertue, the members for vertue, no reaſon doth admit.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Adde to theſe, that while election is ſaid to be for faith fore-ſeene, there is appointed an election, which doth not belong to infants that are taken away by an immature and vntimely death, becauſe they want faith.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Yea, election for faith fore ſeene, cannot be called election, but it is an admiſſion and receiuing of them who come to Chriſt by Faith, and of them, who by their free-will, vſing Grace well, doe firſt chooſe God, in whom they put their truſt before they be choſen by God. Chriſt on the contary ſide ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.16. <hi>Ye haue not choſen me; but I haue choſen you.</hi> The <hi>Arminians,</hi> while they contend that it is here ſpoken onely of election to their Apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhip, doe not obſcurely confeſſe that this place doth hurt them, if
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11390:92"/>it be there ſpoken of election to ſaluation: their will is therefore in the worke of ſaluation, that God be choſen by man, before man be choſen by God. Goe to then, let vs grant, that it is here ſpoken onely of election to their Apoſtleſhip, for that doth not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further our cauſe. For if the Apoſtles were elected to their Apoſtleſhip, not for any fore-ſeene vertue, but were elected to receiue thoſe vertues and gifts, by which they might execute their Apoſtleſhip; it is much more likely, that man is not elected to ſaluation for any fore-ſeene vertue, ſeeing eternall ſaluation is a farre greater benefit then the Apoſtleſhip, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remoued from the power of man, and more exceeding our capacity, and therefore it is a thing whereunto we haue much more neede of the helpe of God, and which is leſſe in the power of mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, then the obtaining of an Apoſtleſhip.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. By the ſame doctrine, faith in Chriſt, is made a thing of mans free-will, in the power whereof, it is to vſe grace, or not to vſe it, to beleeue, or not to beleeue, and to vſe, or not to vſe thoſe powers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, which are giuen vnreſiſtably. Surely <hi>Arminius,</hi> had neuer ſaid that election had beene for ſaith fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene, if he had thought that God had certainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to giue faith to ſome certaine men, whom hee elected to ſaluation, for he acknowledgeth no preciſe and neceſſary decree of God of giuing to any one the very act of beleeuing: For this ſpeech were vnapt, <hi>God elected</hi> Paul <hi>becauſe he fore-ſaw that hee would giue him Faith:</hi> If in election faith be conſidered as already performed, and as that on which election doth reſt, it muſt needes be, that God hath not wrought it:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:11390:92"/>Otherwiſe God ſhould be ſaid to be willing to ſaue a man, becauſe he determined to giue him faith; when on the contrary ſide, he doth therefore giue faith to one, becauſe he hath decreed by his certaine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable will to ſaue him.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. What is to be thought of this doctrine,

                  </note> may be gathered by the conſequents which they build on this foundation: ſuch as are theſe; The election of God in this life is not certaine, nor irreuocable; the number of the elect is not certaine and determined by the will and election of God: the grace of God is not the totall cauſe of faith, which is a grieuous ſpeech, and ouerthroweth the foundations of faith, as we haue already proued, and hereafter more ſhall be ſpoken of the ſame thing.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. What a thing is it? that by this opinion, no man can beleeue that he is elected: For if any one did beleeue he were elected, hee would beleeue alſo that his faith was after his election. So he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he is a man, was a man before he beleeued it: and if faith and perſeuerance in faith, doth goe before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, he who beleeueth in Chriſt, may indeede pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or hope that he is elected, after he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuered; but he cannot beleeue that hee is already elected, ſeeing according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> no man is elected, but after hee hath beleeued, and when he hath ceaſed to beleeue. Hath therefore this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine torne the bowels of the Churches of the Low-Countries, that it might pull out of their mindes he confidence of Election, and that no man, vnleſſe it were impudently and falſely, might beleeue that hee is elected by God to ſaluation?</p>

Doth any one heare our Lord ſaying; Ye haue not choſen me, but I haue choſen you? and dares he ſay that men beleeue that they might be choſen, when rather they are choſen, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chap. 18. <hi>He choſe vs in him before the world was made, that we might be holy and without ſpot: Therefore not becauſe we were holy, but that we ſhould be holy; it is certaine, it is manifeſt: Therefore we were to be ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he elected vs, predeſtinating vs, that by his grace we ſhould be holy.</hi>

               <p>In the ſame place the <hi>Pelagians</hi> reiecting election for workes fore-ſeene, ſticke onely in the fore-ſeeing of faith: <hi>Wee</hi> (ſay they) <hi>doe ſay that our God fore knew nothing, but faith whereby we beginne to beleeue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he elected vs, &amp;c.</hi> Againſt theſe things Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> diſputeth much, and at the length he doth thus conclude his ſpeech, <hi>Neither doth faith it ſelfe goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for he doth not chooſe vs becauſe we beleeue, but he choſe vs that we might beleeue, leaſt we ſhould be ſaid to chooſe him firſt: and that ſhould be falſe</hi> (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) <hi>which Chriſt ſaith, ye haue not choſen me, but I haue choſen you: Neither are we called, becauſe we doe beleeue, but we are called, that we might beleeue, and by that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which is without repentance, it is wrought, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought, that we ſhould beleeue.</hi>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:11390:95"/>to perſwade that election is of them that beleeue, and that the decree of Predeſtination, is nothing elſe but the will of ſauing them that beleeue. This is to doe another thing, and not to touch the queſtion, for the controuerſie betweene vs, is not concerning theſe things. The ſtate of the queſtion is this <hi>Whether electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be for faith fore ſeene:</hi> Then alſo, whether God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſeuerall and certaine perſons, doth conſider in them perſeuerance in faith, as a thing already ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and as a condition, on the performance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Election doth reſt.

And that God in electing, doth conſider men as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; <hi>that is,</hi> as thoſe that by his gift were to haue faith: And that the decree of election is with reſpect of faith; becauſe the decree of ſaluation doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude alſo the decree of the meanes to come to that end, and therefore alſo of faith in Chriſt.

               <p n="11">XI.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hard to ſee how theſe things can be drawne to election for faith fore-ſeene, ſeeing it is not there ſpoken of election, nor of faith foree-ſeene, he addeth theſe words, <hi>Therefore Election to ſaluation is not the decree concerning the end of men, as they are men ſimply, but of the ſaluation of men, as they are ſuch ſort of men,</hi> to wit, <hi>of them that are faithfull, and of them that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in the faith.</hi> This alſo we confeſſe in that ſenſe which we ſaid before; but it were better to ſay, <hi>of them that were to perſeuere,</hi> becauſe God electing, doth not conſider faith and perſeuerance, as a thing perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but as a thing to be performed, and that by his bounty and gift.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. He further addeth, <hi>The will of beſtowing the reward, the wages, &amp;c. doth neceſſarily preſuppoſe the fore-ſeeing of faith, and perſeuerance in faith, by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of the Goſpell, if thou beleeueſt and doeſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere, thou ſhalt be ſaued.</hi> Here you digreſſe from the queſtion: For it was ſpoken of election for faith fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene; but you ſpeake of ſaluation which is beſtowed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:11390:98"/>after faith. God electing to ſaluation, doth fore-ſee that faith will come before the obtaining of ſaluation, but he doth ſo fore-ſee it, that God foreſeeth that which he himſelfe is to worke, which to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is not to fore-ſee, but to will. Furthermore, eternall life, is called the reward of faith, becauſe it is not to be had, but after the fight of faith, neither can we come thither but by labour; but it is not giuen for the labour, neither are we choſen to ſaluation, for the fore-ſeeing of labour or faith; but God who doth predeſtinate vs to the reward, doth alſo prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate vs to the fight: As <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.26. <hi>It is giuen to you in the behalfe of Chriſt, not onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, but alſo to ſuffer for him.</hi> It is alſo a kinde of reward freely beſtowed, as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>The reward of liberality and of grace, doth differ from the ſtipend of vertue, and wages of labour.</hi> In the meane while, the Reader ſhall note by the way, that the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſtriue for election, vpon the fore-ſeeing of workes: For eternall life in the holy Scripture, is called the wages or reward not onely of faith, but alſo of workes, of almeſdeedes, of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, according to that of <hi>Matthew, Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>Call the labourers, and giue them the pay.</hi> If therefore it may thence be proued, that election is for faith fore-ſeene, becauſe eternall life is called the reward of faith, why ſhall not the ſame election be for workes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene, ſeeing eternall life is often called the reward of workes; eſpecially ſeeing to beleeue, is it ſelfe a worke, and that the chiefeſt worke, and the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are of opinion, that we are iuſtified by faith, as it is a worke, as ſhall be ſeene in his owne place?</p>

               <p n="13">XIII. The ſame man, <hi>P.</hi> 170. and 188. doth much pleaſe himſelfe in this argument. <hi>If predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſuch as you faine it to be, then the will of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſaluation of a man that is to be ſaued, is two fold, and contradictory to it ſelfe: One whereby he doth will and ordaine ſaluation to him that doth not beleeue,</hi> that is, <hi>not for faith fore-ſeene: The other, whereby in time he will not ſaue the ſame man, vnleſſe as he is faithful.</hi> But I deny that theſe things are contrary: To elect to ſaluation him that doth not beleeue, that he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and to will the ſaluation of him that beleeueth.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The maior propoſition doth mingle falſe and true things together, that thoſe that are falſe might lye
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:11390:99"/>hid in the multitude, nor is it in all reſpects true. There is no doubt, but that whatſoeuer men, &amp; what ſort of men God in time doth ſaue, the ſame men, &amp; the ſame ſort of men he hath decreed to ſaue: But that God doth ſaue them in the ſame order in which he decreed, is one way true, and another way falſe. It is true that God doth ſaue in the ſame order in which he decreed to ſaue; but it is not true, that God in executing or ſauing, doth follow the ſame order which he did in decreeing: For in decreeing, he firſt thinkes of the end, before he thinkes of the meanes: Contrariwiſe, in executing, hee beginneth with the meanes and helpes, and finiſheth in the end. So the Phiſitian doth firſt intend health before phyſicke, but in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, he doth firſt apply the medicines, before he healeth. <hi>Greuinchouius</hi> therefore doth erre, who from the order which God doth follow in executing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, doth gather what ſhould be his order in decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the meane while, by the way obſerue in <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinchouius</hi> the ſpirit of <hi>Arminius:</hi> He dares not ſay that God giueth faith, but that hee giues onely the meanes to faith, becauſe he will haue it to be in the power of free-will to vſe theſe meanes, and that faith is but the gift of God in part.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The argument of <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 181. hath the ſame fault; <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are thus coupled together: that God will firſt haue one belecus, before he will haue him be ſaued; wher as your predeſtination teacheth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarily, that God doth firſt will to ſaue a man and then he willeth that he ſhould beleeue.</hi> In theſe words he doth confound the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of decreeing, with the order of executing: for in the execution of his decree, God will firſt haue him to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:11390:100"/>beleeue, before he will haue him to be ſaued: but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing, God doth firſt decree to giue ſaluation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he decreeth to giue faith; and he firſt thought of the end, before he thought of the meanes.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. The ſame man, <hi>pag.</hi> 195. doth contend that theſe are things incompatible, and which cannot ſtand together, that God would ſaue <hi>Peter</hi> abſolutely, and that he would not ſaue him, but vpon the condition of faith. I anſwere, there is an homony my and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation in the word <hi>abſolutely:</hi> If by <hi>abſolutely,</hi> be vnderſtood certainely, preciſely, or neceſſarily, theſe are not contrary, to will to ſaue <hi>Peter</hi> certainely and preciſely, and to will that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be ſaued by faith: Euen as theſe things are not contrary; To will abſolutely that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould liue, and to will that he ſhould liue by foode and by breathing. But if by theſe words, <hi>To will to ſaue, abſolutely,</hi> be vnderſtood that God will ſaue without faith: then we are ſlandered, for there is none of vs of this opinion, none beleeues it: but that this is the meaning of <hi>Greuinchouius,</hi> the following words declare, for he addes, <hi>Theſe things are contrary, to will that the ſame man ſhould beleeue, and that he ſhould not beleeue.</hi> Which of vs, yea, what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath euer ſaid, that God doth will that a man ſhould not beleeue in Chriſt? and yet hee doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe that opinion to <hi>Caluin,</hi> citing in the margent his <hi>Inſtitutions, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 18. §. 13. where there is no ſuch thing, nor hath there beene any more rigid and preciſe maintainer of faith in Chriſt, then that holy man: Therefore after his ſicke minde hath vomited out this poiſon againſt vs, he triumphs, as of a thing well performed, as the Cocke crowing vpon the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill;

                  <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when you haue reconciled, I will ſay you are a great artiſt in reconciling.</hi> But it was not for <hi>Ames,</hi> a man well deſeruing of the Church, to labour in reconciling the doctrine of the Goſpell, with the blaſphemy of Sathan.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The ſectaries are wont, after this manner to accuſe vs of ouerthrowing the Goſpell: <hi>The Goſpell</hi> ſay they) <hi>which on condition doth promiſe life to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer, cannot ſerue for the executing the decree whereby life is preciſely appointed to certaine and determined per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> But I affirme that it doth ſerue; becauſe God promiſeth life vnder a condition, which he decreed to worke in the elect. For what letteth that God ſhould not promiſe life to him that beleeueth, and yet decree to giue faith to thoſe certaine and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſons which he hath elected?</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 52. hath theſe words; <hi>If faith be an effect of election, it cannot be comprehended in the decree of election.</hi> But there is none of vs ſaith, that faith is comprehended in the decree of Election, but a purpoſe or will of giuing faith: And this will hath that reſpect to the decree of election, as the part to the whole; for the decree of the meanes to the end, is included in that decree by which the end is decreed; as in the will of building a houſe, the will of prouiding ſtones and timber is contained.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:11390:101"/>
                  <hi>Arminius</hi> would haue it: Faith is a thing without which God doth not elect, but not that for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing whereof he doth elect. That faith is required in election, although the Scripture doth not ſay it in the ſame words, yet it may fitly be receiued, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaning of the Scripture, if faith be laid downe as a condition following election, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which God will haue no ſaluation. No otherwiſe then breathing is a condition to life, although a man be firſt appointed to life, before to breathing.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. The <hi>Arminians</hi> in their Epiſtle againſt the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrian</hi> brethren, <hi>p</hi> 43. doe thus explaine their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>It ſeemeth moſt inconuenient to vs to affirme, that God in election did decree what he himſelfe would worke in man, by his ſpirit: For by the decree of abſolute election to ſaluation, the conferring of ſaluation alone, and not of faith is decreed.</hi> This their falſe and fooliſh opinion they vphold by this argument: <hi>Seeing that ſaluation and faith are moſt diuers predicates, neither doe they make the ſame thing by it ſelfe, or by accident; it cannot poſsible be, but that the decree of conferring ſaluation is one, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of conferring faith is another.</hi> I anſwere: Although ſaluation and faith are diuers things, yet faith is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary meanes to ſaluation; and the decree of the end includes alſo the meanes; life and breathing are things no leſſe diuers, then faith and ſaluation: and yet by the ſame decree, whereby one is appointed to life, he is appointed alſo to breathing, becauſe breathing is the meanes to life.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. This obiection of the <hi>Arminians</hi> is frequent and worne out with vſing: <hi>If God doth predeſtinate men to faith, as to the meanes by which they ſhould come
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:11390:101"/>to ſaluation, it muſt needes be, that God ſhould alſo prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate the reprobates to incredulity and impenitency, as to the meanes by which they ſhould come to damnation.</hi> But I deny that this followes; for here we ſpeake of the meanes which God himſelfe doth ſupply, but incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and impenitency are meanes which man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath ſuggeſted of his owne. The meanes which God findes already made, are to be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe which he makes: God in predeſtinating, doth conſider man as corrupt and lying in ſinne; whence it comes to paſſe, that the meanes to damnation are already in man: neither is there any neede that they ſhould be ſupplyed otherwiſe, much leſſe by God, who neuer is the author of ſinne. But ſeeing man is naturally deſtitute of the meanes of ſaluation, they cannot come to man, vnleſſe God giue them. Neither is incredulity a condition required after the ſame manner in reprobates, as faith is in the elect; for that is a condition required before reprobation, but this is a condition following election: Thence it is, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity and impenitency, are things deſeruing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, but faith is a thing not deſeruing election nor ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. With that argument another alſo doth fall to the ground, which theſe Sectaries heape vp, euen with a loathſome repetition: <hi>If God</hi> (ſay they) <hi>doth not elect for fore-ſeene faith, then he doth not reprobate for fore-ſeene ſinne.</hi> But I deny that theſe things are alike, or that one followeth of another: for God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth ſinne, becauſe he is not the author of ſinne, but he doth not fore-ſee faith, but doth decree to worke it; and this which God decreeth, he doth not fore-ſee
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:11390:102"/>it, but doeth will it: if we would vſe ſignificant and fit words, and not purpoſely darken things by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper kinde of ſpeech. And truely the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſeeme to mee, to ſtrike themſelues with their owne ſtings: For if this reaſon of theirs preuaile, why may it not alſo be lawfull to reaſon thus. If God electeth without the reſpect of good workes (as <hi>Arminius</hi> will haue it) then alſo he doth reprobate without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of euill workes: The conſequence is the ſame, and yet the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe not admit this. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> after <hi>Arminius</hi> doth heape together many things, by which he would get enuy to our cauſe, and would loade it with hatred, the knowledge whereof is worth the labour, for they are cloathed with much art, and ſearched colours: In the front hee doth place argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which he would proue, that our opinion is contrary to the wiſedome of God.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. He therefore, <hi>Page</hi> 217. doth thus argue. <hi>It is contrary to wiſedome, firſt to ordaine abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to any one, that thing which is loſt, and therefore is not at all, and then to decree that he ſhould obtaine the ſamething.</hi> The ſame homonomy, is in the word <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,</hi> which we noted before in <hi>Greuinchouius,</hi> in the ſixteenth obiection; the anſwere therefore may be ſought for there. But it is not true that this is contrary to the wiſedome of God, no more then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to decree that one ſhould recouer his loſt health, and yet decree that he ſhould take Phiſicke, and ſhould obtaine helpe of the Phiſitian.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. He doth repeate the ſame argument in other words, in the ſame and in the following page, but that he alſo addes, <hi>That it is contrary to the

By one and the ſame decree, God determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſaue certaine men by Faith: But if wee ſhould ſpeake as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth imagine, nothing would thereby be derogated from the wiſedome of God. The father doth often decree to giue ſomething to his children, before he hath determined on what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or by what labour. In this place <hi>Arnoldus</hi> hath ſtuffed in many things of vnreſiſtableneſſe, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, which wee haue put off to another place: Therefore from the wiſedome of God, he paſſeth to the iuſtice of God, which he doth contend to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by vs.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. Therefore, <hi>Pag.</hi> 224. hee beginneth with a calumny. <hi>You determine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to ſaue ſome men without the beholding of Faith.</hi> I ſay he doth falſely accuſe vs: For although God doth not elect vs for faith, yet hee doth elect vs to faith, and faith is a part of the definition of election. But if of two that are alike ſinners, he electeth one to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not conſidering obedience as a thing already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but electing him to performe obedience, God ſhall not therefore be vniuſt: for concerning his owne he doth what he will, according to that, <hi>I will haue mercy on whom I will haue mercy,</hi> &amp;c. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that although he giueth to the one the grace
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11390:103"/>that is not deſerued, yet he impoſeth no puniſhment on the other but what is due. In the meane while the Papiſts haue cauſe to reioyce, who haue ſound a patron of merit in <hi>Arnoldus:</hi> For it is ſaid to be merit, when the reward is giuen to any one for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. Eternall life is a reward, and that it might be giuen for righteouſneſſe, <hi>Arnoldus</hi> will haue it giuen for the beholding of obedience performed, therefore it is giuen to him that merits it.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. It is idle which he addeth <hi>Pag.</hi> 225. <hi>By the decree whereby God hath decreed to giue ſaluation to none but to him that beleeueth, he ſheweth that he doth rather loue obedience, then the creature. But contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by your decree, God is made to loue men, although they be ſinners, rather then righteouſneſſe; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to iuſtice.</hi> Surely theſe things are knit together with a very wicked art. For, firſt he imagines that we teach that God will ſaue other men then beleeuers. Secondly, he doth craithy compare that loue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God loueth obedience, with that loue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God loueth the creature: ſeeing the loue of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (which is the very iuſtice of God) is rather to be compared with the loue wherewith God loueth his goodneſſe and mercy. For although God loueth his owne iuſtice more then the creature, yet hee doth not loue his iuſtice more then his goodneſſe, by which he doth doe good to the creature: for God doth no leſſe giue cleare and certaine proofes and effects of his goodneſſe, then of his iuſtice; which goodneſſe is alſo a kinde of iuſtice, if iuſtice be taken not ſtrictly for that vertue by which rewards are giuen to the iuſt, and puniſhments to the vniuſt; but for that generall
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:11390:103"/>vertue, wherby God doth doe all things conueniently and as it is meete. And although all things are equall in God, yea all the attributes of God are one vertue, and the very eſſence of God, yet the Scripture doth extoll the goodneſſe of God with farre greater praiſes then his iuſtice: So in the Law God doth viſite the iniquity of the fathers vpon the children, vnto the third and fourth generation, but doth extend his mercy to thouſands of generations. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. The iudgements of God are compared to the mountains, and his goodneſſe to the deepe. And <hi>Pſalme</hi> 30. His goodneſſe is extended to a life or an age, but his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is reſtrained to a moment. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this, Chap. 2. v. 13. ſaying that mercy doth boaſt it ſelfe, and glory ouer iuſtice; becauſe God hath manifeſted to vs more euident arguments of his goodneſſe then of his iuſtice. God is therefore rightly called, <hi>Optimus maximus, The moſt good, and the moſt great;</hi> but moſt good is ſet firſt, and then moſt great. And if you would repeate the matter from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, you ſhall finde that in the firſt place the decree of creating is to be laid downe, in which there is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but not iuſtice.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth more largely preſſe the ſame things, Chap. 9. where he ſaith that the iuſtice of God is violated by vs, while wee will haue God to haue ordained men to ſaluation without the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of any obedience; which as I haue already ſaid, is not our opinion. I confeſſe indeede, that God doth loue his owne iuſtice more then man; but I deny that he doth more loue the manifeſtation or execution of his iuſtice, then the manifeſtation of his mercy and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:11390:104"/>goodneſſe towards man. God doth more loue that which is due to him by the creature, then hee doth loue the creature it ſelfe: But he doth not more loue that which is due to him from the creature, then hee doth loue that which he oweth to himſelfe, <hi>to wit,</hi> the manifeſtation of his glory, by doeing good to the creature: Surely there was danger that God could not maintaine his iuſtice, vnleſſe theſe innouators had iſſued forth, who patronize his iuſtice, preferring it before his goodneſſe and wiſedome. And this is the place where <hi>Arnoldus</hi> will haue God to be a debtor: <hi>Iuſtice</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth appoint that God ſhould giue to the creature performing obedience, that which is his.</hi> Neuer was any thing ſaid more harſh by the moſt vehement maintainers of mans merits: Surely <hi>Arnoldus</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſay to God, giue me that which is mine, for this thy iuſtice requireth. O proudely ſpoken! But let vs proceede to other things.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. A little after he doth endeauour to proue that we offend againſt the ſame goodneſſe of God, in the doctrine of reprobation: But wee haue appointed a peculiar chapter for the examining of theſe things, as alſo there ſhall be a place of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe things which he doth euery where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order ſtuffe in, of Reprobation, and of Free will, and of Chriſt the foundation of election.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. It is not to be omitted, that it is famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with the <hi>Arminians</hi> to inuey againſt the doctrine of Election, which is beleeued in our Churches, and that vnder the pretence of piety, and exhortation to good workes. For they ſay that preciſe election doth extinguiſh all the endeauour of good workes, prayers,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:11390:104"/>hearing of the word, and doth takeaway euery pious enterpriſe. For if one beleeue that hee were predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to faith, and to good workes, hee will leaue the care to God of mouing man infallibly, and would ſhake off all wholſome feare, becauſe hee is perſwaded that his ſaluation cannot be loſt, nor his faith caſt off. Theſe and other things borrowed from the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and ſtill warme from the anuile of the papiſts, they carry about, as it were the Circouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an pompe, with a great clamour; Alſo theſe craftie men ſpeake this, as men taught by experience: For they ſay, that while they were of opinion with vs, they felt that vice growing on them by this doctrine, and that a languor and diminiſhing of the loue of God, crept vpon them, and that ſometimes they felt ſome temptations of deſparation: But as ſoone as they ſhooke off that opinion of preciſe election, they were healed of theſe diſeaſes, and their piety grew hot. No doubt wee had bid piety and ſanctitie of manners farewell, if this ſect had not roſe vp, which hath triumphed ouer vices, and hath raiſed vp piety, almoſt dead. I doe not ſearch into their manners: thus much I ſay, their writings reliſh of anger, and are full of bitterneſſe.</p>
               <p>But to the purpoſe. I deny that by our doctrine iuſt occaſion of ſinning is taken, and the raines let looſe to intemperance: But nothing hath euer beene ſaid ſo holily, nor ſo truely, which may not be drawn to the worſer part, and be corrupted by a ſiniſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffered the ſame calumny, who in the ſixt Chapter to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> doth with an opportune prolepſis, and timely preuention, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:11390:105"/>from himſelfe this opinion, ſpeaking thus; <hi>Shall we continue in ſinne that grace may abound?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">XXX. Wee deny therefore that theſe things which they imagine, doe follow of our doctrine. If God hath predeſtinated any one to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he ought not therefore to be leſſe carefull how he may pleaſe God, and yeelde obedience to him. For, repentance is carefulneſſe it ſelfe. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ſpeake as if they ſhould ſay, that the elect ought to want carefulneſſe, becauſe God hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated them to carefulneſſe.</p>
               <p n="31">XXXI. Neither doth the beneficence and bounty of God, hinder the vigilancy and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man. So God giueth vs our daily bread, and yet by this he doth not hinder our labour. He doth in vaine expect from God ſuccours for his life, who doth ſit idle with his armes a croſſe. The ſame God which giueth vs foode, exhorts vs to labour: for his bleſſing doth not come vpon ſloath, but vpon diligence.</p>
               <p n="32">XXXII. Furthermore nothing letteth, that a man ſhould with leſſe diligence follow that labour, the euent whereof is determined by the certaine decree of God, whether this decree be knowne to vs, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not knowne. Chriſt was not ignorant of the tearme of his life vpon earth, and yet did hee auoide the dangers, and eſcaped the hands of the Iewes more then once. <hi>Ezechias</hi> being recouered from his diſeaſe, knew that he had yet fifteene yeeres to liue, in which time it is no doubt, but he receiued foode, and had care of his health. God had reuealed to <hi>Paul,</hi> that none of the paſſengers that were in the ſame ſhip
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:11390:105"/>ſhould be drowned, and yet for all that, he exhorted the Saylors to labour, and commanded them to be kept in the ſhip, who hauing let downe the boate would haue fled. The <hi>Arminians</hi> will not deny, but that the euent of their warres, was determined by the purpoſe of God, yet they would not thence inferre, that it was in vaine to ſight couragiouſly. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth teſtifie in many places, that God hath ſet to euery one the limits of his life, and that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our daies is determined by the purpoſe of God, and yet he is not to be diſpraiſed, who ſends for the Phiſitian in his ſickneſſe, or hee, who before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell puts on armour: For the induſtry of man, muſt ſerue the decree of God; neither is it right, that the liberality of God, ſhould be a cauſe of negligence to vs. So the infant moueth it ſelfe in the wombe, and doth it ſelfe helpe its owne natiuity, although that power which it hath of mouing, is from God. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing faith and repentance are the meanes to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, nothing is ſo contrary to reaſon, as to vſe the end for the aboliſhing of the meanes. Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 2. doth acknowledge that it is receiued from God, both to will and to doe, and yet in the ſame place he doth exhort to worke out our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with feare and trembling; whom wee had rather beleeue then <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> whoſe words are theſe, <hi>Page</hi> 273. <hi>It ſeemes to me, that the conſcience of ſinne, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together extinguiſhed in him, who knoweth that he is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from ſinne by the abſolute and immutable ordinance of God.</hi> What? Was the conſcience of <hi>Dauid</hi> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſinne, or did he looſe the ſence of ſinne, after that God ſignified to him by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:11390:106"/>he had taken away his ſinne? No, he ſorroweth, and doth grieuouſly lament his ſinne: for griefe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance doth ſtick faſt in the minde euer after par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is obtained: So Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. ſaith, that God had mercy on him, and yet in the ſame place he doth deteſt his ſinne.</p>
               <p n="33">XXXIII. Wee are to thinke the ſame thing concerning prayer, as concerning the labour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour of good workes: For we doe rightly and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aske of God thoſe things which are determined by his certaine purpoſe: For God who hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to doe good to vs, will giue that good to our prayers, and not to ſloathfulneſſe and ſecurity. <hi>Ioſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> did not in vaine pray before the fight, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. although he was not ignorant that God had already decreed what ſhould be the euent of the battell. The Apoſtles knew well enough that their ſinnes were forgiuen them by God, and yet they did daily pray, <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes.</hi> Chriſt did not doubt of his reſurrection, and of the obtaining of glory after the combat, and yet he did pray by night, and went aſide into the mountaine to pray.</p>
               <p n="34">XXXIV. I let paſſe, that euery man, euen the beſt, is obnoxious and ſubiect to temptations, which aſſailing him, he is to flie for the helpe of God, leaſt his faith faile, or ſloathfulneſſe and negligence creepe vpon him.</p>
               <p n="35">XXXV. Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo witneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. that the holy-Ghoſt prayeth in vs, and doth ſuggeſt ſighes and prayers, whence hee is called by <hi>Zacharie, the ſpirit of ſupplication. Zach.</hi> 12.10. Which ſeeing it is the effect of the good pleaſure of God,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:11390:106"/>and the fruit of election, it were a maruaile if election it ſelfe ſhould keepe vs back from prayer.</p>
               <p n="36">XXXVI. And if any man that is elected doth yet doubt of his ſaluation, he hath ſomewhat to aske of God, <hi>to wit,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a full perſwaſion, and the ſuſtaining of his ſtaggering faith, and the increaſe of charity and zeale, and the obtayning of glory; and if he be certaine of his ſaluation, hee muſt aske the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of this confidence, hee muſt aske perſeuerance in faith and good works, hee muſt pray to bee kept backe from ſinne, to which he feeleth himſelfe prone: he muſt pray for the fulfilling of the promiſes of God, he muſt pray againſt the temptations of Sathan, who although hee cannot ouerthrow the elect, yet he doth prick their heele, and doth dig into them with his goades.</p>
               <p n="37">XXXVII. That is of the ſame lumpe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Arnoldus</hi> from <hi>Arminius, Pag.</hi> 304. doth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide vs. <hi>Your doctrine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth make the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and Miniſters of God ſloathfull in their miniſtery, becauſe from thence it followeth that their diligence can profit none, but thoſe whom God will abſolutely ſaue, and who cannot periſh, and againe their negligence can hurt none but thoſe whom God will abſolutely deſtroy, and who cannot be ſaued.</hi> The <hi>Pelagians</hi> obiected the ſame things to Saint <hi>Auſtin.

                  </note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto wee haue already largely anſwered: For the ſame reaſons which ſtirre vp the carefulneſſe of the hearers to repentance and good workes, are alſo of power to ſtirre vp paſtors diligently to vndergo their office, and to prick forward their hearers to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: For although the elect cannot periſh, yet wee
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:11390:107"/>know that God doth bring the elect to ſaluation, by the word and ſacraments, and by the miniſtery of the Goſpell, whoſe decree our obedience muſt ſerue.</p>
               <p>And although the miniſter of the word, dealing perfunctoriouſly and careleſly cannot cauſe, that he that is elected ſhould periſh, yet hee hurts himſelfe, and ſhall beare the puniſhment of that negligence in the day of iudgement. Therefore although he did not hurt others, yet hee ſhould very much wrong him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> a moſt vehement maintainer of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, doth profeſſe that he <hi>endureth all things for the elect, that they may obtaine ſaluation.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p n="38">XXXVIII. As concerning the Reprobates, if this reaſon of <hi>Arminius</hi> preuaile, by the like reaſon we ſhall neyther eate nor drinke, nor ſhall parents be bound to be carefull of the health of their children: becauſe this negligence can hurt none but them whom God will haue to periſh, who by his decree hath ſet ſure bounds to the life of euery particular perſon, which cannot be pulled backe, nor paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And if it were manifeſt to the paſtors, which of their flocke were Reprobates, then there were ſome colour for the doubting, whether they ought to be carefull for the ſaluation of them that are Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: But ſeeing that this is vnknowne to them, they ought to ſcatter the ſeede of the word euery where, and leaue the euent to God.</p>
               <p n="39">XXXIX. <hi>Arnoldus, Page</hi> 307. ſaith, that which in my iudgement is exceeding bad: <hi>If any one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould teach, that God himſelfe hath preciſely appointed to nouriſh one for ſome time in this life, and that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:11390:107"/>he would ſo prouide the bread where with he ſhould be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, that he could not but haue it aboundantly: I grant that ſuch a one neede not be warned that hee ſhould be carefull, how to prouide himſelfe bread.</hi> But I affirme, that ſuch an one needes, and ought to be warned to prepare himſelfe bread; becauſe the ſame God who doth promiſe bread, and hath decreed to giue it, doth alſo declare in his word that he will giue this bread to our labour, and by the meanes of our carefulneſſe: Therefore he that will giue the bread, doth alſo giue ſtrength, will and induſtry, whereby this bread ſhould be prepared: So that <hi>Arnoldus</hi> yeelds that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which no man in his right ſenſe, would yeeld to him.</p>
               <p n="40">XL. Furthermore, the certainty of Election may be taken two manner of waies, eyther for the immutability of the decree of God, or for that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſwaſion, whereby any one doth beleeue that he is elected: Of the former kinde of certainty, it is onely ſpoken here, the latter doth require a peculiar treatiſe: But by the way, we ſay that we beleeue none of thoſe things which <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth falſely attribute to vs, whereof this is one; that all men are bound to beleeue that they are elected to eternall life: Nay, we teach, that he that will not beleeue in Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, is bound to beleeue that ſaluation gotten by the death of Chriſt, doth not pertaine to him: Of the ſame ſtampe is that calumny, when he ſaith, that we command wicked men to be ſecure, as they that can loſe ſaluation by no euill deedes. Fie on that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable doctrine. To ſay, <hi>I am elected, therefore I may be wicked,</hi> is the ſpeech of a reprobate man, who
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:11390:108"/>will therefore be wicked becauſe God is good. By this meanes, that loue wherewith God in Chriſt hath loued vs, which is the moſt vehement incitation to loue God, is turned into a pillow, on which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſecurity may ſleepe. Whoſoeuer God hath elected, he hath giuen him, or will giue him, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt, by which he abſtaineth from ſo prophane a thought. So him whom hee hath appointed to life, he hath appointed alſo to foode and to breathing. He were ridiculous who ſhould ſay, if God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that I ſhould liue till I am eighty yeeres old, what neede I eate, ſeeing it cannot be but I muſt liue ſo long? Surely the deſtruction of ſuch a man is neere; for God hath determined to vſe this his ſenceleſſe pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhneſſe to puniſh him.</p>
               <p n="41">XLI. In the meane while wee admoniſh, that the certainty of the election of ſeuerall perſons, is carefully to be diſtinguiſhed from that certainty whereby ſeuerall men beleeue themſelues to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: The former is the certainty of the decree, the latter is the certainty of faith. For if <hi>Arminius</hi> could proue, that piety and the endeauour of good workes, is extinguiſhed by the perſwaſion of election, yet it would not thence follow, that the decree of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the election of particular perſons, is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and preciſe: But it would onely follow, that this decree is not to be beleeued by vs to be certaine. Whence it appeares how ill <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> doe reaſon, who thereby inferre that the decree of God, concerning the election of particular perſons, is not abſolute nor preciſe, becauſe the confidence of election, doth make ſome men more negligent to the workes of piety.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:11390:108"/>
               <p n="42">XLII. Adde to theſe, thoſe things which we haue laid downe in the ſecond chapter, where we haue ſhewed how many waies the doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning election, is profitable to good manners, and to the diſcipline of piety, which notwithſtanding wee would haue thus to be taken, not that euery one is to expect a reuelation of his election, but the Goſpell is to be heard, and this promiſe, whereby God doth promiſe life to them that beleeue, is throughly to be faſtned in our minde, and to be embraced with our whole heart: By which perſwaſion, whoſoeuer ſhall feele himſelfe to be liuely affected with the loue of God, and to be driuen to repentance, ſhall eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he is elected, and that the thing promiſed in the Goſpell doth belong to him. For although electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in nature before faith and repentance, as the cauſe from whence theſe vertues flow, yet faith and repentance is better knowne to vs, and we are alwaies to proceede from the things that beſt are knowne: whence it commeth to paſſe, that many times we goe to the cauſe, by the effects, which order in the ſchooles is called <hi>Reſolutiuus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="43">XLIII. And if we would imitate <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> it were an eaſie thing to lay theſe things vpon him, and to teach how many waies his doctrine doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt the wiſedome and goodneſſe of God, and therefore alſo againſt his iuſtice: How many waies occaſion may thence be taken either of diſtruſt or of frowardneſſe, by what meanes it doth blow vp a man while he burſt, and lift him vp on high, that it might throw him downe headlong; For, one that is filled with <hi>Armianiſme</hi> may ſay thus. God indeede is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:11390:109"/>willing to ſaue me, but he may be diſappointed of his will, hee may be defrauded of his naturall defires, which are farre the beſt: Thoſe whom God will ſaue by his Antecedent will, hee will deſtroy by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent will: Alſo his election doth reſt on the fore-ſeeing of mans will; I were a miſerable man, if my ſaluation depended vpon ſo vnſtable a thing. The ſame man will alſo reaſon thus; God giueth to all men ſufficient grace, but hee hath not manifeſted Chriſt to all men, therefore there is ſome grace ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient without the knowledge of Chriſt. Alſo the ſame man will eaſily beleeue that God doth mocke men, for he hath learned in the ſchoole of <hi>Arminius,</hi> that God doth ſeriouſly deſire &amp; intend the ſaluation of all and ſingular men, and yet that neuertheleſſe he doth call very many by a meanes that is not congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, <hi>that is,</hi> by a meanes, in a time and meaſure, which is not apt nor fit, by which meanes, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is called, doth neuer follow God calling. But what doe I know, whether he calleth by a congruent and agreeable meanes or no? Adde alſo theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous opinions, that vnregenerate men doe good workes; that they are meeke, thirſting after and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of the Father; that faith is partly from grace, and partly from free-will: Nay, what that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maintainer of the ſect of <hi>Arminius,</hi> ſhall dare to ſet lawes to God himſelfe, and to ſay that God <hi>is bound</hi> to giue to all men power of beleeuing? And that the iuſtice of God doth require, that he may giue to man that which is his owne, and that man himſelfe may determine and open his owne heart to receiue the word of God. O your fidelity! Are theſe your famous
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:11390:109"/>incitations to holineſſe of life? Doth <hi>Arminius</hi> traine vp men to piety by theſe inſtructions? Surely if any one is ſtirred vp to good workes by theſe things, hee is thereby the more corrupted. For, God had rather haue ſinnes with repentance, then righteouſneſſe with pride. God will not ſtirre vp men to repentance, with the loſſe eyther of our faith or his glory: Nor are we onely to doe our endeauour that men be ſtirred vp to repentance, but we muſt alſo ſee that it be done by meanes that are conuenient, and not contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt God.</p>

There are not wanting examples of moſt wicked men to one whereof (God ſo diſpenſing) the Goſpell hath beene preached, whence it came to paſſe that he was conuerted and did beleeue, but to the other the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell hath not beene preached: The Scripture doth not ſay that the death of Chriſt is the cauſe of this, but doth fetch the cauſe from the good pleaſure of God, who hath mercy on whom he will: For the loue of the father doth alwaies goe before the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſonne, ſeeing that the loue of the father
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:11390:110"/>to the world, was the cauſe why he ſent his ſonne.</p>
               <p>Yea truely, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe, as he is man, is elected, and the head of the elect, hee cannot be the foundation and cauſe of election: For as hee is the head of men, as he is a man; ſo is he the head of them that are predeſtinated, as he is a man predeſtinated to ſo great honour, which came to him by the meere grace of God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Wherefore the Apoſtle calleth Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the price of our redemption, and, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">III. Reaſon it ſelfe doth conſent. For as the recouery of the ſicke-man doth in the intention al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies goe before the vſing of the Phiſitian; ſo it muſt needes be, that in the minde of God, the thought of ſauing men was (not in time, but in order) before the thought of ſending the Sauiour.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Adde to theſe, that the mediation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt, is an action whereby the iuſtice of God is ſatisfied, which is not ſignified by the word Election; for it is one thing to be a mediator, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing to be the cauſe of Election, or of the preferring of one before another in the ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God: Whence it is, that Chriſt is the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of our ſaluation, but not of our election; which is as much as if I ſhould ſay, that Chriſt is the foundation and cauſe of the execution of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Election, but not the cauſe of Election it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is of no ſmall moment that Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.13.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:11390:110"/>ſaith, <hi>That he layeth downe his life for his friends:</hi> &amp; chap. 10. v. 11. he calleth himſelfe <hi>the good ſhepheard, that layeth downe his life for his ſheepe:</hi> And if Chriſt be dead for his friends, and for his ſheepe, it muſt needs be, that when he died for them, he did conſider them as being already friends and ſheepe, although many of them were not then called, as Chriſt himſelfe doth teſtifie, who in the ſixteenth verſe of the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth call thoſe alſo his ſheepe, who were not yet conuerted. And if Chriſt dying for vs, conſidered vs as his friends and ſheepe, it is plaine, that before the death of Chriſt, there was already deſtinction made betweene his friends and enemies, betweene the ſheep and goates, and therefore that the decree of Election was in order, before the death of Chriſt, and that the opinion of <hi>Arminius,</hi> is to be hiſſed out, as an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſubuerting the Goſpell, whereby hee thinkes that the election had not place when Chriſt died. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that died for his ſheepe, died for the elect, and not for them who were to be elected after hee was dead.</p>
               <p>By theſe things it is plaine, that by thoſe friends and ſheepe for which Chriſt died, are not vnderſtood thoſe, onely, who loue God and follow Chriſt, but all thoſe whom God loueth, and whoſe ſaluation hee decreed: for whom Chriſt died when they did not yet loue God, and when they were enemies to him. And therefore they are called enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. becauſe they did not loue God, but yet euen then they were highly loued by God, and were appointged to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt: For in a diuers reſpect they were both friends and enemies, ſheepe and goates: Friends
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:11390:111"/>becauſe God loued them, enemies becauſe they did not yet loue God.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Neither is iniurie done to Chriſt, if the loue of the Father, and his good pleaſure be ſaid to goe in order before the decree of ſending his ſonne, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe doth witneſſe it <hi>Iohn,</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> where the loue of the father is manifeſtly ſet before the ſending of the ſonne, which is ſo to be vnderſtood, as that the ſonne is not excluded from the act of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſelfe; ſeeing that he alſo is one God with the father, but this was done by him, not as hee is media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but as he is God.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Neither is any iniury done to Chriſt, if the will of the father concerning the ſauing of men, be ſaid to goe before the redemption of Chriſt, ſeeing that this redemption is alſo after ſinne: for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is before the medicine.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Nor is any thing detracted from the greatneſſe of the price of our redemption, if his will who offered the price, be ſaid to goe before it.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The very definition of the decree of election, doth proue this thing; for election is the decree of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing certaine men by Chriſt, in which definition, Chriſt is laid downe, not as the cauſe of election, but as the meanes of the execution of it, and as the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe of ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="10">X. It is maruailous, how much the <hi>Arminians</hi> inſult here: For becauſe wee make the loue of God to goe (not in time, but in order) before the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſonne, they ſo deale with vs, as if we taught,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:11390:111"/>that God loued vs without Chriſt, and as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without faith in Chriſt, which doth differ as much from our opinion, as that which doth differ moſt. Be it farre from vs, that wee ſhould ſay, that God would euer beſtow ſaluation vpon vs, but that together and in the ſame moment he conſidered vs in Chriſt, as being to be ſaued by him: Nor was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſe why we for that thing ſhould be accuſed of Sicianiſme; we haue nothing to doe with that Alaſtor and helliſh monſter, which doth altogether ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the benefit of Chriſt: But it is one thing to ſay that the loue of the father doth, in order, goe before the mediation of the ſonne; and another thing to ſay that God loueth vs without the ſonne. It is one thing to diſpoſe the thoughts of God in order, and another thing to ſeparate them, and pull them aſunder. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> who in the beginning of his booke againſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> calleth himſelfe a wirty fellow, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h craftily, yea wickedly catch at and hunt after points of priority in order, to pull aſunder thoſe things which cannot be ſeperated. Hee doth therefore as much as if one ſhould ſay, that the thought of creating man, was firſt in order, in God, before the thought of ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with holineſſe and righteouſnes, and would thence inferrre that God would firſt create man not iuſt, or firſt to haue conſidered him as not holy. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſaith that in the decree of God, the thought of ouerthrowing of the world, was before the thought of ouerthrowing it by fire, hee doth not therefore ſay, that God firſt thought of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing it without fire. All the purpoſes of God are eternall, although there be a certaine order
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:11390:112"/>and dependency betweene them.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That place of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chap. 3. vexeth <hi>Arminius: God ſo loued the world, that hee gaue his onely begotten ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> where the loue of God is laide downe, as the cauſe by which it came to paſſe, that he gaue the ſonne: He doth therefore endeauour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude ſo direct a place by a witleſſe cauell, <hi>That loue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not that by which he will giue eternall life; which appeareth by the very words of</hi> Iohn, <hi>who doth ioyne faith betweene this loue and eternall life.</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore ſhall obſerue, that <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe doth acknowledge, that there is a kinde of loue of God towards men, which doth goe before his decree of ſending his ſonne. But hee ſaith that God by that loue is not willing to giue eternall life. What then will hee doe by it? For this thing hee ought to ſhew. Will God by that loue, leaue men in death? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that God ſhould loue the creature, created by him to life, but he muſt needes by the ſame loue, will that it ſhould liue? I am aſhamed of ſo weake a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty. Yea truely, in that he ſent his ſonne, by that loue it is ſufficiently manifeſt, that by that loue he was willing man ſhould be reſtored to life: But (ſaith he) faith commeth betweene that loue and eternall life: What then? Cannot I will the recouery of him that is ſicke, although the Phiſition come betweene my will and his recouery. Surely he maketh thoſe things oppoſite and contrary, which are appolite, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together. But I doe not ſee how he rather fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Socinus,</hi> who ſaith that Chriſt is not the cauſe of Election, then he that ſaith that Chriſt is not the cauſe of the loue whereby God would ſend Chriſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:11390:112"/>into the world, and prouide for vs a redeemer: Or why there ſhould be a greater offence in making the redemption of Chriſt to be the <hi>medium,</hi> and meane betweene the loue of God, by which hee elected vs, and betweene our ſaluation, then if it be made the <hi>medium,</hi> a meane betweene the loue of God, by which he will giue Chriſt for vs, and betweene our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For on both ſides redemption is made the meanes, and not the firſt cauſe. Let vs not therefore enuy God the father this praiſe, that his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thould be made the fountaine and firſt originall of our Election.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Obſerue moreouer that that Election whereof <hi>Arminius</hi> will haue Chriſt to be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that generall election, whereby all men are conditionally elected, which ſeeing wee haue largely conſuted, Chap. 18. whatſoeuer the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe bring to proue that Chriſt is the foundation of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, doth vaniſh away. Surely there was no cauſe why they ſhould ſo earneſtly labour to proue that Chriſt was the foundation of that election, by which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> were elected: Of which imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry election, he ſhall haue the true character and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture, who hath brought in God ſpeaking thus: <hi>I decreed to ſend my ſonne to ſaue all men who ſhall beleeue, but who and how many they ſhall be, I haue not determined; onely I will giue to all men ſufficient power to beleeue, but he ſhall belecue who will himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Arminius</hi> doth defend himſelfe againſt ſo euident a truth, by one little word of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath elected vs in Chriſt:</hi> But it is one thing <hi>to be elected in Chriſt,</hi> and another thing to be
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:11390:113"/>elected for Chriſt, ſo that Chriſt ſhould be the cauſe why one is elected rather then another. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle is cleere: <hi>To elect,</hi> is nothing elſe then <hi>to appoint to ſaluation.</hi> Therfore to elect in Chriſt, is to appoint to ſaluation, to be obtained in or by Chriſt: For whoſoeuer God hath decreed to ſaue he hath giuen them to Chriſt, and hath conſidered them as ioyned to Chriſt. Hee ſeeketh a knot in a bulruſh, who by farre fetched interpretations would darken that which is perſpicuous and plaine.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. For a foundation of this their opinion, <hi>Arminius,</hi> and after him <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> doth lay this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: <hi>That Predeſtination is the foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> This demand he will haue to be granted him, for he doth not proue it; no otherwiſe then if one in the beginning of a diſputation, would obtaine by ſuite, and would deſire that it might be granted him, <hi>that a circle hath corners.</hi> This is a great demand, and that which I thinke no man would grant him, who knoweth what predeſtination is, and what is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtian Religion. The foundation, of Chriſtian Religion is, to acknowledge that Chriſt, the onely ſonne of God, is ſent from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>whoſoeuer beleeueth in him might not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> It muſt needes be that the foundation of Chriſtianity be the rule of faith, on which the faith of Chriſtians muſt reſt; but prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination is not the rule of faith, but the action of God, whereby bee determined to ſaue certaine men by Chriſt. Farre be it from vs that wee ſhould ſay, that the ſecret decree, by which ſeuerall men, as <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Charles, &amp;c.</hi> are elected, is the foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:11390:113"/>Whoſoeuer would from thence beginne to teach Religion, and would beginne the elements of Chriſtian faith at this decree of Predeſtination, hee ſhould eyther, by the darkeneſſe caſt before him, tremble at the very entrance, or ſhould fall downe right, as being taken with giddineſſe. Whatſoeuer things therfore <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth build on ſo falſe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, doe of themſelues fall to the ground, ſo that we neede not ouerthrow thoſe things, which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues will fall downe. Further alſo he doth impugne and ſtriue againſt that thing which is not beleeued by vs, <hi>to wit,</hi> that we are loued by God without Chriſt; onely the ambiguity wherewith he would deceiue the Reader, is to be noted, when he ſaith, <hi>Page</hi> 171. <hi>That Chriſt is the foundation of our receining into grace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the loue of God.</hi> If by receiuing into grace and loue, he vnderſtand the reconciliation by his ſatisfaction performed for vs; I confeſſe that Chriſt is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that receiuing into grace, and of that loue: But if by receiuing into grace and loue, be vnderſtood that loue of the father, by which hee would ſend his ſonne to ſaue vs (which is the greateſt loue of all, and the fountaine of all good) certainely <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe would not haue Chriſt to be the foundation of that loue; and yet by that very ſame loue, God choſe from eternity whom he would.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. I doe not ſearch into that which <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> boldly and raſhly hath dared to ſay, that God could not ſaue vs otherwiſe then by Chriſt, nor had he any other meanes for the ſaluation of man. <hi>God could not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will eternall life to any one without the reſpect of a mediator:</hi> And the <hi>Arminian</hi> conferrers
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:11390:114"/>at the Hage; <hi>It is impoſsible for God to decree ſaluation to ſinners, but that he muſt before haue decreed the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his iuſtice:</hi> Now they ſpeake of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt. Surely they doe boldly and raſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the wiſedome of God within limits, and if this thing were true, yet it were not for man to ſpeake ſuch things: It is ſufficient that God hath followed the moſt conuenient way, and then which none is better. By the way it is to be obſerued, that this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath not pleaſed <hi>Vorſtius.</hi> He, <hi>Page</hi> 33. <hi>diſput. de Deo,</hi> doth affirme, <hi>That it was lawfull for God to relent or yeelde ſomewhat of his owne right, no leſſe then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or purſue that which is his right.</hi> And <hi>Page</hi> 399. <hi>It is falſe to ſay, that no ſinne could be let paſſe vnpuniſhed by the iuſtice of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">XVII. The conferrers at the Hage doe thus argue: <hi>If the decree of Chriſt the Sauiour, be after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the election of ſome particular perſons to ſaluation, then God decreed the ſaluation of ſome particular perſons, in order before he decreed the ſatisfaction of his iuſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a maniſold deceite: For the decree of ſauing certaine men, and the decree of ſending Chriſt to ſaue them, they make two decrees, when it is but one; for election is the decree of ſauing certaine men in Chriſt. It is not one decree by which God hath appointed man to life, and another, by which he hath appointed him to breathing. There is another fraud in that they compare the ſaluation of ſeuerall men with the ſatisfaction of Gods iuſtice, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon was to be made, of the manifeſtation of the goodneſſe of God, by which hee doth ſaue ſeuerall men, with the ſatisfaction of his iuſtice. It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:11390:114"/>if God be ſaid firſt to haue decreed the manifeſtation of his goodneſſe, before the ſatisfaction of his iuſtice. Adde to theſe that they doe craftily vſe theſe words, <hi>the election of ſome particular perſons,</hi> to extenuation and contempt; for theſe ſome particular perſons, are the Church of the Elect, whoſe ſaluation is of ſo great account with God, that for the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, he would ſatisfie his owne iuſtice: Whence it followeth, that God, that he might declare his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, did firſt intend their ſaluation, before the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his iuſtice.</p>

               <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE doctrine of Reprobation, is ſo farre profitable to the elect, in as much as by the compariſon of the lot of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates with theirs, they are ſtirred vp to the praiſe and admiration of the bounty of God towards them. Then alſo when the pledges of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doe begin to faile, and the ſpirit of adoption is grieued by the luſts of the fleſh, it is profitable to the faithfull to be ſtriken with ſome horrour, and to be ſtirred vp to try themſelues, whether they proceede in regeneration, or whether they grow worſe and fall backe, that ſo pricks and incitements might be put to them that are ſloathfull.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The very word election doth proue, that there are ſome that are reprobates; for there were not ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; vnleſſe the reſt were paſſed by and reiected. The
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:11390:115"/>Scripture maketh mention of Reprobates, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Which ſtumble at the word, being diſobedient, whereunto alſo they were appointed.</hi> And <hi>Iude</hi> 4. <hi>Certaine men are crept in vnawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation.</hi> Theſe in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> are noted out vnto vs, by thoſe who are not written in the book of life, the number of whom Chriſt doth inſinuate to be very great, when hee ſaith, <hi>Many are called, few choſen.</hi> The ſame is proued by experience: For not onely before the comming of Chriſt, but alſo at this time there are very many nations to whom the name of Chriſt is not knowne, without the knowledge of which there is no ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Reprobation is the decree of God, by which from eternity he decreed, not to giue to certaine men his grace, by which they might be freed from their engrafted deprauation, and from the curſe due to them, and appointed them to iuſt and deſerued pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for their ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The definition of <hi>Thomas</hi> doth not pleaſe me, who ſaith that the decree of Reprobation is <hi>the will of permitting one to fall into ſinne, and of laying vpon him the puniſhment of damnation for his ſinne:</hi> For the permiſſion whereby God doth permit, doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to predeſtination, but to his prouidence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſerue to predeſtination.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is the opinion of the <hi>Arminian</hi> ſect, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates may be ſaued: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith <hi>Arminius) that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is not of the power, but of the act of ſauing.</hi> Very ill ſpoken: For where the act of God is determined by his decree, in vaine is the power by which this act may be reſiſted. This opinion doth draw with it
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:11390:115"/>other opinions no better then it ſelfe, for errors are tyed together among themſelues like ſerpents egges: For if a Reprobate may be ſaued, he that is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of life, may effect that hee be now written in, and ſo the number of the elect will not be certaine, nor the decree of Reprobation be irreuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and peremptory (as they ſpeake) vnleſſe after fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perſeuerance in incredulity. Alſo hence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that a reprobate may, if he will, obtaine faith, and conuert himſelfe: whence it would come to paſſe, that faith ſhould not be of the meere grace of God, which wee ſhall ſee hereafter to be the opinion of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. God is, after the ſame manner, the cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, as the iudge is the cauſe of the puniſhment of them that are guilty, and ſinne is the meritorious cauſe. Seeing therefore the conſideration of ſinne doth moue the iudge, and the iudge doth condemne to puniſhment, it appeareth that ſinne is the remote cauſe of damnation, and not onely a condition neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fore-required, and that the iudge is the next and neereſt cauſe.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Furthermore although ſinne be the cauſe of appointing to puniſhment, yet it is not the cauſe of the difference betweene the Elect and Reprobate. For examples ſake: Two men are guilty of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:11390:116"/>thing ſteppeth betweene, which doth turne the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from one of them; which in the worke of predeſtination is nothing elſe but the very good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, by which of his meere good pleaſure, he gaue certaine men to Chriſt, leauing the reſt in their inbred corruption, and in the curſe due vnto them. For which difference, it is great wickedneſſe for vs to ſtriue with God, ſeeing hee is not ſubiect nor bound to any creature, and puniſheth no man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly, giuing to one the grace that is not due, and impoſing on the other the puniſhment that is due.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Here it is demanded what is that ſinne for which God doth reprobate, <hi>to wit,</hi> whether men are Reprobated onely for the ſinne which is deriued from <hi>Adam,</hi> and for that blot which is common to Reprobates with the elect, or whether they are alſo reprobated for the actuall ſinnes which they are to commit in the whole courſe of their life. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is at hand: For although naturall corruption be cauſe ſufficient for Reprobation, yet it is no doubt but that God hath decreed to condemne for the ſame cauſe for which hee doth condemne; and hee doth condemne the Reprobates for the ſinnes which they haue committed in act: For in hell they doe not onely beare the puniſhment of originall ſinne, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of actuall ſinnes: Therefore alſo God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to damnation for the ſame ſinnes. Now to Reprobate, and to appoint to puniſhment, are all one. God doth ſo execute any thing in time, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he from eternity decreed to execute it: Now he doth puniſh in time for actuall ſinnes, therefore
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:11390:116"/>alſo hee decreed from eternity to puniſh for them Thence it is that the puniſhments of the men of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, was to be greater then the puniſhment of the Sodomites, and the puniſhment of him that knew the will of his maſter, greater then the puniſhment of him that knew it not, becauſe there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the actuall ſinnes for which they are puniſhed. Nothing hindreth, that God conſidering a man lying in his naturall corruption and deprauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould not alſo conſider him as poluted with thoſe ſinnes which he was to commit by that naturall deprauation.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Arminius</hi> doth not thinke that any man is Reprobated for originall ſinne, for he contends that Chriſt hath obtained the remiſſion of it for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. But he will haue man to be reprobated onely for the fore-ſeeing of actuall ſinnes, <hi>that is,</hi> for the breach of the law, and the contempt of grace: In which thing he doth ſeeme not to be conſtant to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For ſeeing all actuall ſinnes doe flow from ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, it cannot be, that the cauſe and fountaine of actuall ſinnes ſhould be remitted by God, and yet the ſinnes that flow from thence ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: As if God ſhould forgiue a man intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but ſhould puniſh him for adultery; for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe flow from habits and naturall inclinations, as the ſecond acts doe flow from the firſt.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Without doubt incredulity, and the reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpell are among the ſinnes, for which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one is reprobated; For by this reiection we ſinne againſt the Law, by which God will iudge vs: For the law commandeth that God be loued with all our
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:11390:117"/>heart, and that he be obeyed in all things, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, and therefore alſo that he be beleeued when he ſpeaketh, and that hee be obeyed when hee commandeth vs to beleeue, whatſoeuer it ſhall be which he ſhall eyther command or ſhall ſay.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That hee ſhould be Reprobated for reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Goſpell, and deſpiſing the grace of Chriſt, to whom the Goſpel was neuer preached, is againſt all reaſon: For, whom the Goſpell doth not ſaue, it leaueth vnder the law, to be iudged by it, which law doth then binde a man to beleeue in Chriſt, when Chriſt is preached to him: Nor is it the Schoole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to Chriſt, but to them who haue meanes to come to the knowledge of Chriſt; After the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the law did not binde them to belecue the prophecy of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> who neuer heard of the name of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> nor could it be knowne to them.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. And although reprobation cannot be ſaid to be the cauſe of ſinne, becauſe ſinne goeth before reprobation, yet it cannot be denied but that repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is the cauſe of the denying of grace, and of the preaching of the Goſpell, and of the ſpirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is peculiar to the elect: For ſeeing this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying is a puniſhment, it muſt needes be, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the will of a iuſt iudge.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:11390:118"/>of the creatures, ſometimes in any generall knowledge of the law: Of which curſed doctrine, and how by theſe things they doe not obſcurely paſſe into the campe of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> ſhall be ſpoken in their due places.</p>

But here we are euery where ſet vpon by their darts, and the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe abundantly caſt reproaches vpon vs, and doe faigne to themſelues monſters which they may kill. The conferrers at the Hage, <hi>Page</hi> 122. after they haue belched out ſome calumnies, doe thus conclude their ſpeech: <hi>Theſe things are briefely ſpoken,</hi>

The good men ſing this <hi>Cuckowes</hi> ſong to vs ſixe hundred times, attributing to vs the doctrine which we neither beleeue nor teach: For if one hath not decreed to giue to him that is blinde the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by which he might recouer his ſight, hee is not therefore the cauſe of his blindneſſe, nor hath hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to blindneſſe.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. They ground on a falſe foundation, on which they build thoſe things which are worſe. For they thus beginne their ſpeech of Reprobation, <hi>Page</hi> 118. <hi>It is knowne to the</hi> Contraremonſtrant <hi>brethren, that ſuch as Election is on the one part, ſuch Reprobation ought to be on the other part.</hi> This is the fountaine of their error; this falſe beginning hath led aſide thoſe acute men into by waies: The reſpect of Election is one, the reſpect of Reprobation is farre other. For
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:11390:118"/>ſinne and in fidelity is not a condition required after the ſame manner in the reprobates, as faith is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required in the elect: For ſinne is a condition fore-required in reprobates, but faith is a condition following election. Reprobation is made for ſinne, but election is made to faith. Sinne is the cauſe of the appointing to puniſhment, faith is the effect of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God findeth ſinne, but worketh faith. Sinne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth reprobation onely in the neceſſity of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but not in the neceſſity of the conſequent: But faith doth follow election both waies. By theſe things that calumny is abundantly waſhed off which <hi>Arnoldus, Page</hi> 228. and in many other places doth ſprinkle vpon vs, that we deny that the reprobates are reprobated for ſinne.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. It yeeldeth an occaſion to the <hi>Arminians</hi> of falſely accuſing vs, becauſe we ſay, that the decree of reprobation is preciſe and abſolute, nor doe we agree to <hi>Arminius,</hi> who teacheth that the reprobates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede are not ſaued, but yet they might be ſaued, and who denieth that the number of the reprobates is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the decree of God.

               <p n="20">XX. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> addeth; <hi>Your doctrine determines that God doth exact faith from the reprobates, and that he decreed to condemne them if they ſhould not beleeue, when yet it is impoſsible for them that they ſhould beleeue in Chriſt with a ſure perſwaſion of minde, not onely becauſe God doth not giue them power of beleeuing, but alſo becauſe

Here are many things faiſe. Firſt, it is falſe that faith is exacted and required of all the reprobates, for it is required onely of them to whom the Goſpell is preached. Neither is it true that faith is abſolutely, and without condition required of all thoſe, to whom the Goſpell is preached; for it is required vnder a condition, <hi>to wit,</hi> that they be conuerted and repent: But if they doe not repent, we teach and cry out, that the benefit of Chriſt doth not pertaine to them; and that they hope and beleeue in Chriſt in vaine, ſo long as they are aduerſe and contrary to God, inuiting them to repentance: And it is alſo falſe, that God is vniuſt, if he command them to beleeue and obey, who for their inbred deprauation cannot beleeue and obey, and to whom God doth not giue power of beleeuing; for man himſelfe hath brought this impotency and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility on himſelfe, and this deprauation, in man, is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary; and God exacting from man, that he ſhould beleeue him ſpeaking by Chriſt, doth require nothing which man doth not owe: For to obey the law is a naturall debt. For God, ſpeaking by Chriſt, cannot be refuſed or contemned, but the law alſo is broken, as we haue already taught at large in many places, eſpecially Chap. 11. Where we haue taught that the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:11390:120"/>power of beleeuing was giuen vs in <hi>Adam,</hi> and that <hi>Adam</hi> had it before the fall, but an occaſion of vſing it was wanting: And therefore alſo this power was loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi>

And it is not for vs to enquire ſcrupulouſly into the end which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to himſelfe.

               <p n="22">XXII. He doth bend at vs another dart, <hi>Page</hi> 286. <hi>Your doctrine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth repugne the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall threates: For ſeeing the intent of God in the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:11390:120"/>propounding of them is, that men ſhould be driuen from impenitency, and ſo ſhould be ſaued. You on the contrary ſide teach, that God doth deny to ſome men the meanes that are neceſſary to repentance, becauſe he hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to ſaue them.</hi> Firſt, it may be doubted whether there are any Euangelicall threats; for the threatnings which are contayned in the bookes of the Goſpell, are not a part of the Goſpell. For ſeeing the word <hi>Euangelium, Goſpell,</hi> doth ſignifie, a good meſſage, I doe not ſee how threatnings can belong to a good meſſage: They who beleeue not the Goſpell ſhall be puniſhed, not by the Goſpell, but by the law. But howſoeuer it be, I ſee nothing here which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne theſe threates, by which God doth intend to require from man that which is due, and that which the law it ſelfe requireth, <hi>to wit,</hi> that God be obeyed. Seeing that the denying of grace, and of the reſtoring of the powers which man by his owne fault loſt, doth very well agree with ſuch a declaration of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. Theſe things are not repugnant, to propound life to man on the condition of obedience, and not to reſtore to man thoſe powers of obedience which hee loſt by his owne fault.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. Neither are theſe things repugnant, to propound life to any one vnder a condition, and to appoint the ſame man to death for his fore-ſeene diſobedience.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. The ſame man ſince <hi>Arminius, Page</hi> 269. (for that which he addeth concerning Infants ſhall hereafter be handled) doth thus inuey againſt our opinion. <hi>Your opinion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>cauſeth that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers cannot be offered to God, as it is meete they

               </p>
               <p n="25">XXV. I anſwere, that it is falſely ſuppoſed by <hi>Arminius,</hi> that publike prayers ought to be poured out with this confidence, that they ſhall profit all them that heare the word. This faith were raſh, and not reſting on the word of God; eſpecially ſeeing the miniſters of the word, haue, for the moſt part, known many that are diſobedient and openly prophane, nor doe they doubt, but that beſides theſe, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are ſicke, and ill affected with inward and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vices, who yet make a ſhew of piety. Certainely the ſimilitude of the ſeede ſowne into diuers ground, and of a differing diſpoſition, and with an vnlike ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, doth in this caſe bring more feare then confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And yet becauſe the ſecrets of reprobation are vnknowne to vs, we doe rightly pray for all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we hope well of euery one. I doe not ſee where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this obiection belongs, vnleſſe to ſtop and ſtay the Reader with a childiſh declamation, becauſe this very obiection doth no leſſe purſue <hi>Arminius,</hi> who although he will not haue the decree of God to be preciſe, yet doth confeſſe, that God doth certainely fore-know who are to be damned. And to confeſſe this, what is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:11390:121"/>it elſe, then to teach that God is willing that wee ſhould pray for them, whom he certainely knoweth our prayers will not profit? But that which he caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon vs, that we make the decree of reprobation to goe before all things and cauſes, and therefore alſo before ſinne it ſelfe, is plainely contrary to our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.: And if ſuch words haue fallen from any vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, it is not therfore the opinion of our Churches, we defend thoſe things that are ours, but we doe not warrant other mens.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. Concerning the place of the Apoſtle, where hee ſaith that God would haue all men be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it ſhall be ſpoken in his order and place.

The grace of Chriſt is ſaid to bring ſaluation to all men, when notwithſtanding ſo many periſh. This is a token here, of that in the former place it is ſpoken of kings, in this place of ſeruants: Their domination was at that time contrary to Chriſt, and the lot and ſtate of theſe men, was abiect and baſe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would not hinder that they ſhould not be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and theſe are thought ſuch as may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of ſauing grace.</p>

               <p n="3">III. They thinke that the end which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to himſelfe in deliuering his Sonne to death, was not to apply this benefit to ſome certaine men; nor doe they thinke that Chriſt was appointed to death, by the preciſe will of God; to ſaue man, for Chriſt was appointed to death by his father, before God thought of ſauing of men, and therefore that he was appointed to death without that reſpect, that they which beleeue in him ſhould be ſaued. <hi>Greuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chouius, Page</hi> 21. doth ſay expreſſely, that reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being obtained, there was yet no neceſſity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>that is,</hi> after ſaluation and reconciliation for all men was obtained, there was no neceſſity that any one ſhould be ſaued, and it was poſſible that no man in act ſhould be reconciled: Becauſe he will haue the decree of ſending Chriſt, in order, to goe before the decree of ſauing thoſe which beleeue, and therefore that God determined to ſend his Sonne, when he had not yet determined to ſaue thoſe which beleeue. But the <hi>Arminians</hi> would haue this to be the end which God propounded to himſelfe in ſending his Sonne, <hi>to wit,</hi> to make the ſaluation of men poſſible, and to lay open a way for himſelfe, whereby hee might ſaue finners, without any hurt to his iuſtice.

               <p n="8">VIII. We doe very much differ from this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: We acknowledge that Chriſt died for all; but we denie, that by his death ſaluation and forgiueneſſe of ſinne is obtained for all men: Or that reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:11390:123"/>is made for <hi>Cain, Pharaoh, Saul, Iudas, &amp;c.</hi> Neither doe wee thinke that remiſſion of ſinnes is obtained for any one, whoſe ſinnes are not remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or that ſaluation was purchaſed for him, whom God from eternity hath decreed to condemne: For this were a vaine purcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. We denie that election is after the death of Chriſt, as for many other cauſes, ſo alſo becauſe Chriſt in the very agony of death gaue a notable proofe of election in the theefe, whoſe heart he affected, and enlightned his minde after an vnvtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner; the other theefe being left and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. And ſeeing Chriſt doth euery where ſay that he died for his ſheepe, and for thoſe whom his father gaue him, he doth ſufficiently declare that he died for the elect.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And when we ſay that Chriſt died for all, we take it thus, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the death of Chriſt is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſaue whoſoeuer doe beleeue, yea, and that it is ſufficient to ſaue all men, if all men in the whole world did beleeue in him: And that the cauſe why all men are not ſaued, is not in the inſufficiency of the death of Chriſt, but in the wickedneſſe and incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of man. Finally Chriſt may be ſaid to reconcile all men to God by his death, after the ſame manner, that we ſay that the Sunne doth enlighten the eyes of all men, although many are blinde, many ſleepe, and many are hid in darkeneſſe: Becauſe if all and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men had their eyes, and were awake, and were in the middeſt of the light, the light of the Sunne were ſufficient to enlighten them. Neither is it any doubt but that it may be ſaid, not onely that Chriſt died for all men, but alſo that all men are ſaued by Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:11390:124"/>among men, there is none ſaued but by Chriſt: After the ſame manner that the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20, that <hi>all men are made aliue by Chriſt,</hi> becauſe no man is made aliue but by him.</p>

And ſeeing it is not equall nor iuſt, that reconciliation ſhould bee obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ſuch, the death of Chriſt is vſed wrongfully to obtaine ſomething that is vniuſt, and to doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is contrary, to the iuſtice of God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And who but hee that doth willingly ſhut his eyes, will euer beleeue that the reconciliation of <hi>Iudas,</hi> was obtained by the death of Chriſt, ſeeing that the death of Chriſt, was the very crime of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and by it he was brought to the <hi>halter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. And ſeeing that at the very time in which Chriſt did die, many were already tormented in hell, he muſt needes be of a ſhallow braine, who thinketh that by the death of Chriſt, ſaluation or reconciliation was obtained for them.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Alſo by this doctrine God is openly mocked:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:11390:124"/>For Chriſt is imagined to obtaine that from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he knew would neuer profit; as if God ſhould grant to his ſonne the ſaluation of that man which from eternity he decreed to condemne. For if Chriſt obtained reconciliation and remiſſion of ſinnes for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> whether conſidered as Reprobates, or conſidered as ſinners, hee knew well enough that that obtaining of it would not be for their good or profit. Chriſt therefore is brought in asking this of his father: <hi>I pray thee receiue into grace thoſe whom I know thou wilt neuer receiue into grace, and whom I know certainely are to be condemned:</hi> For Chriſt in his death, and before his death, knew full well the ſecrets of election. Surely theſe men ſeeme to doe their endeauour that Chriſtian Religion ſhould be made a <hi>laughing ſtocke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Alſo they expoſe God to deriſion, while they will haue God at the ſame time, to loue and hate the ſame man; to loue him becauſe hee giueth his ſonne for him, and would haue reconciliation to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for him, but to haue hated him, becauſe from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity he decreed to condemne him.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And if Chriſt obtained remiſſion of ſins for <hi>Iudas;</hi> it muſt needs be that God granted that to Chriſt ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, &amp; that he forgaue the ſins of <hi>Iudas:</hi> Which if it be true, it neceſſarily followeth that God doth aboliſh his owne acts; and condemning <hi>Iudas,</hi> puniſhed thoſe ſins which were remitted, and ſo men ſhould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for thoſe ſins, the pardon whereof is obtained: &amp; the teſtament of Chriſt by which they wil haue ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be purchaſed for all men, ſhould be made void.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Neither is God onely thus mocked, but
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:11390:125"/>alſo he is made to mocke mankinde: For it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by vſe, and by the experience of all ages, that the Goſpell is ſcarce preached to euery tenth man, and that the name of Chriſt is vnknowne to the greateſt part of the world; which thing that it is done by the prouidence of God, ſo diſpenſing, there is none that will deny, vnleſſe he that thinkes that all things are carried confuſedly, and that they doe proceede with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon or order. And if reconciliation and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by Chriſt be purchaſed for all men, why doth not God publiſh this benefit through the whole world? Why doth he ſuffer this reconciliation to be vnknowne to the greateſt part of mankinde? Why doth he keepe in and hide from ſo many men the grace which doth belong to them, and which is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for them; without the knowledge of which, no man can be ſaued? They anſwere, that God doth it becauſe men ſhew themſelues vnworthy of this grace. As if any man could be worthy of it, or could ſhew himſelfe worthy of it. Who knoweth not that the Goſpell is preached to them that are moſt vnworthy? <hi>And where ſinne hath abounded,</hi>

                  <hi>there grace hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</hi> And if God is hindred by the vnworthineſſe of man, that he ſhould not make knowne to him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation obtained, the ſame vnworthineſſe could and ought to hinder the obtaining of reconciliation. For when reconciliation was obtained, God did then fore-know the vnworthineſſe that would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, with no leſſe certainty then if it had beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. And when they ſay that Chriſt died for all, as concerning the obtaining of ſaluation, but not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:11390:125"/>as concerning the application of it, they doe plainely confeſſe that Chriſt did not obtaine that this reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation ſhould be applied to all. Whence it commeth to paſſe, that this obtaining of reconciliation, is vaine, yea, and ridiculous: For they ſpeake as much as if they ſhould ſay, that freedome was obtained for one, but not that he ſhould be freed; or that foode was obtained for one, but it was not procured that hee ſhould be fed with this foode.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And ſeeing that by faith the application of the death of Chriſt is made, if Chriſt by his death hath not obtained for vs the application of this reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will follow that he hath not obtained faith for vs: For they muſt needes deny that faith is obtained for vs, who will not haue faith to be from grace alone, but to be partly from free-will, in whoſe power they will haue it to be to refuſe or admit grace, to beleeue in act, or not to beleeue.</p>

And ſurely hee that ſhall more attentiuely conſider what theſe words meane; <hi>The obtaining of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and the application of the thing obtained,</hi> will finde that it is a meere Meteor, or building of Caſtles in the ayre, and that they are <hi>vnſeaſonable</hi> trifles, with which they enwrap mens wits: ſeeing Chriſt doth obtaine nothing which he doth not apply, nor doth he apply any thing which he hath not obtained: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in vaine were the obtaining of that benefit, which both he that obtaineth it, and he of whom it is obtained, knoweth that it will neuer be applied, and that it will neuer profit him, for whom it is obtained; Nor is it credible that the remiſſion of that ſinne which ſhall neuer be remitted, is procured.</p>

               <p n="11">XI. Yea, theſe innouators doe ſo ſpeake, as they that would haue by the death of Chriſt ſomething to be procured, not for vs, but for God: For they ſay that by the death of Chriſt, God obtained power of ſauing vs, but they denie that the application or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of ſaluation was obtained by the death of Chriſt for <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> but that onely a gate and way was opened for them, by which they might come to ſaluation: Wherefore Chriſt by his death will be ſaid to be, not the giuer, but the preparer of ſaluation. And certainly the opinion of <hi>Arminius</hi> doth tend thither, that Chriſt ſhould be ſaid, not to haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reconciliation for any one, but to haue laid open a way for God, by which he might beſtow ſaluation.</p>

               <p n="13">XIII. It is of no ſmall moment, that if recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation were obtained for all mankind, it muſt needs be that all infants, borne without the couenant, are reconciled, their ſinne is forgiuen them: Whence it would come to paſſe that they could not haue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter benefit beſtowed vpon them, then if one in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cruelty ſhould kill them in their cradles: For if they die in this ſtate of reconciliation, their ſaluation is certaine; but if they liue, they ſhall be brought vp in paganiſme, which is the moſt ſure way to eternall deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. And ſeeing no man can be ſaued, but hee for whom reconciliation hath beene obtained, and hath alſo beene applied: I doe not ſee what the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of reconciliation doth differ from the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in infants, which are taken away by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death: For (by the doctrine of <hi>Arminius</hi>) they are ſaued by reconciliation alone. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that diſtinction of the obtaining of reconciliation and of applying of it, doth vaniſh away: Which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, although it may haue place among men, yet with God it cannot haue place, who granteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he doth not giue, from whom nothing is obtained which hee doth not giue and conferre in act: For to him all things are fore-ſeene ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any thing happen, by which hee ſhould be compelled to deny what hee hath granted, to

And if theſe two things be compared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene themſelues, to obtaine reconciliation for his enemies, that they might be ſaued, and to beſtow ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation on them that are already reconciled, it is no doubt, but that it is farre greater loue, to die to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile his enemies, then to giue ſaluation to them that are reconciled. The Apoſtle teacheth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his ſonne, much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled, we ſhall be ſaued by his life.</hi> If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> be beleeued, it is an eaſier and more likely thing, to ſaue him that is reconciled, then to reconcile him that is an enemy, by dying for him. Seeing therefore that Chriſt (if we giue credit to <hi>Arminius</hi>) hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for all men that which is farre the greateſt, and is an argument of his higheſt loue; it will be ſaid, that Chriſt in dying for vs, loued <hi>Pilate, Iudas, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> no leſſe then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> But there is no man can make himſelfe beleeue, vnleſſe it be hee that is willing to be deceiued, that Chriſt loued thoſe with his greateſt loue, whom his father from eternity ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and whom the ſonne himſelfe knew were from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity appointed to puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Yea truely, ſeeing Chriſt, as hee is one God with the father, hath from eternity predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the reprobates to damnation, it is not likely, yea not poſſible, that the ſame Chriſt hath obtained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for <hi>Iudas,</hi> as hee is man and a mediator, and hath from eternity reprobated the ſame man, as hee is God. For although theſe ſectaries will haue the decree of reprobation to be, in order, after the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:11390:127"/>obtaining of reconciliation, yet neither of them is in time before the other, and it muſt needes be that the deſire of reconciling, and the decree of reprobating were together in one and the ſame minde.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. Notable is the ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater loue hath no man then this, that one lay downe his life for his friends.</hi> The meaning of Chriſt is, that friends cannot be more loued then by dying for them: For although it be greater loue to die for ones enemies then for his friends, yet it is certaine, that nothing can be performed for thy friends ſake, by which thou maiſt more teſtifie thy loue to them, then if thou die for them. Seeing therefore that this is the greateſt loue to die for one, whether friend or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, it muſt needes be that Chriſt equally loued all men, with his greateſt loue: They muſt therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, if they will be conſtant to themſelues, that Chriſt, in dying, loued with his greateſt loue, <hi>Iudas, Pilate,</hi> yea <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who were already in hell.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. The conferrers at the Hage, doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to quit themſelues: <hi>If</hi> (ſay they) <hi>to loue in the higheſt degree, is not onely to merit ſaluation, but alſo to beſtow it, we denie that Christ did generally loue all thoſe, in the higheſt degree, for whom he died.</hi> They therefore condemne Chriſt, and accuſe him of a lie, who will haue this to be the greateſt degree of loue, to die for one. And it is impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould loue any one in the higheſt degree of loue, but that alſo hee ſhould beſtow ſaluation vpon him. And if theſe things could be ſeparated, yet this would remaine firme and ſure, that Chriſt loued him with his greateſt
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:11390:128"/>loue for whom hee died, although hee hath not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards beſtowed ſaluation vpon him, becauſe the greatneſſe of the loue of Chriſt, is to be eſteemed, not by the profit that commeth to him for whom hee died, but by the greatneſſe of the ſorrowes which hee ſuffered for him: Yea, whoſoeuer ſhall weigh theſe things, in the exact ſcale of iudgement, ſhall finde that it is greater loue to ſuffer death for one, to procure for him ſome little good, then to procure great good. So it is more flagrant loue to expoſe himſelfe to death, that his friend might not be hurt, no not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, then if he ſhould doe it, that his friend ſhould not periſh by being burnt aliue.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. Nor doe they <hi>eſcape</hi> by the diſtinction of this loue, into Antecedent and Conſequent, ſeeing the Antecedent loue wherewith they will haue <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to be loued by Chriſt, cannot but be the greateſt, and that beyond which (as Chriſt himſelfe witneſſeth) none can be extended. Theſe are not two loues, to be willing to haue mercy before faith, and to be willing to ſaue after faith; but they are two effects of one and the ſame loue.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. And if Chriſt by his death was the pledge, and price of redemption for <hi>Iudas, Pharaoh, Saul, &amp;c.</hi> The marke of iniuſtice would be ſet vpon God, who hath taken two puniſhments for the ſame ſinnes, when the firſt ſatisfaction did ſuffice, and hath twice giuen iudgement vpon the ſame thing: For once they were dead in Chriſt, ſeeing Chriſt ſuſtained their perſon vpon the croſſe, and yet the ſame men doe die the eternall death in their owne perſons. Thence alſo it will follow that Chriſt did in vaine beare the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:11390:128"/>puniſhments due to <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and that hee in vaine made himſelfe a pledge for them: For ſurely if Chriſt on the croſſe, was the pledge of all and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men, <hi>and made</hi> himſelfe for them as a ſurety, it muſt needes be, that hee ſupplied their place on the croſſe, and ſuſtained their perſon: And ſo that may be ſaid of all men without exception, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.14. <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead.</hi> But no man yet, as I know, hath dared to ſay, that the reprobates died with Chriſt, or in Chriſt. And truely the following words of the Apoſtle doe argue, that he doth not ſpeake of all men in the whole world, but of all thoſe to whom the fruit of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt doth pertaine, and who are become new creatures.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI.

               <p n="22">XXII. In the eight Chapter, and foure and thirtieth verſe of the ſame Epiſtle, it is not onely ſaid that Chriſt died for the elect, but becauſe that Chriſt died for them; the Apoſtle doth thence inferre that no accuſation can be laid againſt them: <hi>Who ſhall lay
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:11390:129"/>any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth: Who ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt that died, &amp;c.</hi> Out of which place we thus argue: They for whom Chriſt died cannot be condemned, nor can any thing be laid to their charge: But the reprobates are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and ſomething is laid to their charge; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt died not for them; So it be vnderſtood in that ſence which I ſaid at the beginning, <hi>to wit,</hi> that Chriſt by his death did not obtaine reconciliation and ſaluation for them.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. Thoſe for whom Chriſt obtained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and remiſſion of ſinnes, for thoſe he alſo prayed and made interceſſion: But he doth not make interceſſion nor pray for the world, but onely for the faithfull, as Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt giuen me.</hi> It is no doubt but that by the world thoſe that doe not beleeue are to be vnderſtood, and thoſe that haue not receiued the grace of Chriſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom alſo are <hi>refractary perſons:</hi> For theſe, Chriſt ſaith, he doth not pray; Now all men are ſuch by nature, being deſtitute, not onely of faith, but alſo of the power of beleeuing. But among theſe, God giueth ſome men to Chriſt, to whom alſo hee giueth faith in Chriſt: For theſe alone Chriſt doth profeſſe that he maketh interceſſion to his father.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. Here the ſectaries after their manner doe vſe a ſleight diſtinction: For they make a double interceſſion; one generall, whereby Chriſt doth make interceſſion for all, the other particular, whereby hee doth make interceſſion onely for the faithfull. By the firſt, reconciliation of ſinnes is obtained; by the other,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:11390:129"/>the applying of reconciliation and ſaluation: But this generall interceſſion is plainely needeleſſe; for in vaine is reconciliation asked, without the application of ſaluation. By that generall interceſſion, Chriſt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther asked ſaluation for <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> or elſe hee did not aske: If he asked not, his interceſſion was to no purpoſe; If he asked, he ſuffered the repulſe, and ſo in vaine he made interceſſion: But hee himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.42. that he was alwaies heard by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But perhaps they will haue Chriſt to haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the application of ſaluation for all men, on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>to wit,</hi> if they will beleeue; and with this reſpect, that they ſhould beleeue: Truely if it be ſo, then Chriſt hath not made interceſſion for all. For that which is asked on a condition, take away the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it is not asked. He that ſaith to God, <hi>I pray to thee for all, ſo they beleeue,</hi> doth plainely declare that he doth not pray for them which doe not beleeue: Wherefore Chriſt himſelfe doth reſtraine his ſending into the world, and therefore alſo his interceſſion, to the faithfull alone, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13. <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he ſent his onely begotten ſonne, that whoſoeuer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> There you ſee that not onely the fruit or application of the donation and giuing of the Sonne (that I may ſo ſpeake) but alſo the donation it ſelfe doth belong onely to beleeuers.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. But it is worth the labour to know what that particular interceſſion is, with which (as theſe ſectaries doe confeſſe) Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. doth make interceſſion for the faithfull alone, and to know what it is that he asketh by it. <hi>Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>keepe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:11390:130"/>them:</hi> And a little after, <hi>I pray thee that thou wouldeſt keepe them from the euill.</hi> If this interceſſion be peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the faithfull, I doe not ſee what remaineth for the generall interceſſion: For without theſe things all interceſſion is vaine. And ſeeing in the Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er theſe two things are asked ioyntly, and together, <hi>to wit,</hi> remiſſion of ſinnes, and freedome from euill, who would endure ſuch a bold forgery, whereby the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe pull aſunder theſe things, and will haue Chriſt to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes for all, but not freedome from the euill?</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. And if Chriſt prayeth for all, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo for them whom hee knoweth doe ſinne the ſinne vnto death, for which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth not ſuffer vs to pray, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.16.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. Yea, the <hi>Arminians</hi> here are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to themſelues, when they ſay that Chriſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede by a particular interceſſion for the faithfull, and for thoſe whom the father gaue to the Sonne; for ſeeing they teach that the faithfull &amp; godly men may fall from the faith &amp; be condemned, it appeareth that they will haue Chriſt to intercede for many repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates by a particular interceſſion, if many of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are reprobates.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. <hi>Arminius, p</hi> 70. againſt <hi>Perkins,</hi> doth bring for this purpoſe many things, which I doe not know whether they will be alowed by his followers. Firſt, he thinks that Chriſt doth ſacrifice himſelf for many, for whom he doth not make interceſſion: becauſe his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing was before his interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For he wil haue the ſacrificing of Chriſt; to pertaine to his meriting, &amp; his interceſſion to pertain to the application of his merit. Theſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:11390:130"/>things ſeeme to me to be repugnant, not onely to the truth, but euen to common ſence: For whoſoeuer doth prepare himſelfe to be a <hi>purging</hi> ſacrifice for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, doth neceſſarily pray that the ſacrifice which he is to offer, may be pleaſing and acceptable for him for whom he doth offer himſelfe for a ſacrifice.

Surely theſe things which <hi>Arminius</hi> doth heape vp, are nothing to the purpoſe, nor doe they touch the matter: For although the prayers which Chriſt offered vp for our ſaluation before his death, are grounded on the merit of his death that was to come, yet that remaineth which <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt doth not ſacrifice himſelfe for them for whom hee doth not pray: For the death of Chriſt had not beene a ſacrifice, vnleſſe hee had prayed that it might be accepted of the father, for their life for whom he died: For griefe and torment is not of its owne nature a ſacrifice, vnleſſe there be alſo ſuch a petition.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. I doe not deny, but that Chriſt in his death prayed for them that crucified him: But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that he prayed for all without exception, but for them alone who did it by ignorance; for he ſaith: <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgiue them, for they know not what they doe, Luke</hi> 23.24. Whom a little after, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doth teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, were conuerted to the faith. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.17. Doth not Chriſt ſay this with an humane affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and not as the redeemer? For, as he was man, he might wiſh well to thoſe, whom as he was God, he knew were reprobates: Thus hee wept ouer the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Ieruſalem, the fall and reiection of which Citty, as he was God he had decreed.</p>
               <p n="30">XXX. And when the ſectaries doe deny, that Chriſt on the croſſe ſuſtained the perſon of the elect, they doe openly <hi>impugne</hi> that ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.11. <hi>I am that good ſhepheard, the good ſhepheard giueth
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:11390:131"/>his life for his ſheepe.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater loue then this hath no man, that one ſhould lay downe his life for his friends.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Chriſt loued his Church and gaue himſelfe for it.</hi> Chriſt therefore died for his ſheepe; for his friends; for his Church; and what are theſe but the faithfull and elect? Can <hi>Pharaoh, Iudas, &amp;c.</hi> in any reſpect, be called the ſheepe of Chriſt? The <hi>Arminians</hi> anſwere, that they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſheepe, not in reſpect of the preſent condition, but of that to come. A vaine thing: For the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come, was already preſent in the decree of God, in reſpect of which decree, they are called ſheep before their conuerſion, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.16. For they are called ſheepe, not onely becauſe they were to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelus to the fould of Chriſt, but becauſe God in his eternall counſell, decreed to giue them faith, by which they might gather themſelues to the fould of Chriſt: For if they had not beene giuen to Chriſt, vntill they had ioyned themſelues to Chriſt by faith, they had giuen themſelues to Chriſt, before God had giuen them to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="31">XXXI. In the meane time it is to be obſerued, with what fidelity theſe ſectaries doe deale here: For they will haue God to haue choſen thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: Neither doe we deny it, ſo that by beleeuers, thoſe be vnderſtood, who are to beleeue by the gift of God, and thoſe to whom God hath decreed to giue faith: For we ſay that faith is conſidered as a thing to be performed, and not as a thing preſent and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready performed; and when wee ſpeake of Election, we ſay that beleeuers are called, not in reſpect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, but of that to come. This thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:11390:132"/>it be agreeable to reaſon, and to the word of God, yet it is reiected by theſe ſectaries, as abſurd: And yet the ſame men a little after doe vſe the ſame thing, and yeeld to our part: For they will haue that ſpeech, <hi>I giue my life for my ſheepe,</hi> to be taken in reſpect, not of the preſent condition, but of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that they are called ſheepe, becauſe they ſhall gather themſelues to the fould of Chriſt. There is no cauſe therfore why they ſhould ſo much be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when we ſay, <hi>that beleeuers are elected,</hi> not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the preſent or paſt, but of the future conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by the beholding of that faith, by which, by the gift of God, they are to come to ſaluation. That which pleaſeth them, when themſelues ſay it, ought not to diſpleaſe them when it is vſed by vs: Eſpecially ſeeing the Scripture doth neuer expreſly ſay, <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers are elected;</hi> but doth cleerely pronounce that Chriſt died for his ſheepe, and for the Church.</p>
               <p n="32">XXXII. For theſe cauſes the holy Scriptures, which doth ſometimes ſay that Chriſt died for all, in that ſence which I haue ſaid, doth oftentimes ſhorten and reſtraine that generall ſpeech, laying, <hi>that the blood of Christ was ſhed for many, Matth.</hi> 26.28. And <hi>that the ſonne of man came, that he might giue his life, a redemption for many.</hi> And, <hi>that he was offered once for the ſinnes of many. Heb.</hi> 9.28.</p>
               <p n="33">XXXIII. And if <hi>you would fetch the matter</hi> from the beginning, and from the couenant which God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> you ſhall finde that this couenant doth belong onely to them alone, whoſe heele the Serpent bruiſeth, and whom hee hurteth with a light
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:11390:132"/>wound, and therefore onely to the faithfull, and the elect; for the reſt, the ſerpent infecteth with his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, killeth them with his biting, and taketh them away with a deadly wound.</p>
               <p n="34">XXXIV. And if Chriſt by his death obtained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for <hi>Cain, Pharaoh, Iudas,</hi> &amp;c. It muſt needs be, that Chriſt redeemed them: But he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them, becauſe they alway doe and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine captiue: Nor is it credible that Chriſt would pay the price of redemption for them, whom he knew were neuer to be freed; or that Sathan could take away thoſe ſoules, redeemed by Chriſt with ſo great a price.</p>
               <p n="35">XXXV. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. ſaith, <hi>That God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world vnto himſelfe.</hi> If by the world, are vnderſtood all and ſeuerall men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception; it muſt be beleeued, that not onely reconciliation was obtained for all and ſeuerall men, but alſo that they are reconciled in act; and that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> were ſometimes among the friends of God: which thing, <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe doth not dare to ſay.</p>
               <p n="36">XXXVI. Finally, if Chriſt hath obtained recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for all men, euen for them who are without the couenant, then no man ſhall be borne without the couenant of Chriſt, and that will be falſe which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. where ſpeaking of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which we are borne, he ſaith, that by nature we are the children of wrath, that is, borne ſubiect to the curſe: For how can any one be borne ſubiect to the curſe, if reconciliation is obtained with God, for all men, without exception.</p>

               <p n="1">I. They bring that place of Saint <hi>Iohn, Chaper</hi> 3. <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. Where God is ſaid to haue ſo loued the world, that he gaue his Sonne: which place wee haue already taught, doth hurt <hi>Arminius;</hi> and that the ſending of the ſame, is in the following words, reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the beleeuers alone. Whence it is manifeſt, that Chriſt was not ſent, but to ſaue them who were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. <hi>I</hi> might ſay that the world is here taken for the faithfull alone; as, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.33. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. and <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But although we grant, that by the world all mankinde are contained in the whole, yet it will not thence follow, that Chriſt purchaſed ſaluation for all, and particular men: for the obtaining of the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome men, doth abundantly teſtifie, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde is loued by God.</p>
               <p n="2">II And it is worth the labour to know what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Arminians</hi> apply to Chriſt, and what accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Arminians</hi> is the ſenſe of theſe words of Chriſt. <hi>God ſo loued the world, that he gaue his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:11390:133"/>doctrine of <hi>Arminius,</hi> this muſt be the ſenſe of theſe words; <hi>God ſo loued all mankinde, with a loue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath not willed their ſaluation, that he decreed to ſend his ſonne, before he thought of ſauing man, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for himſelfe the power of ſauing man, and afterward he decreed to giue euery man power of beleeuing, if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would, that ſo he might haue eternall life.</hi> A monſter of Doctrine, and a new Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They aſſault vs alſo with the words of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> where Chriſt is ſaid to be the propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world. And out of the firſt Chapter of Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> where hee is called the Lambe, taking away the ſins of the world. But by theſe, they effect nothing; for this is ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the whole world no mans ſinnes are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but by Chriſt. In the ſame ſenſe that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>In Chriſt all men are made aliue;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man is made aliue, but by him. So hee that ſhould ſay, that <hi>Hypocrates</hi> taught all <hi>Graecia</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> the art of Phyſicke, did not ſay that all and ſeuerall men of <hi>Graecia</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> learned Phyſicke of him, but that no man learned Phyſicke but from him. For it is manifeſt, that Chriſt hath not taken away the ſinnes of all and ſeuerall men, becauſe very many remaine in ſinne, and are condemned for their ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. They doe colourably boaſt of that place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4 <hi>God would haue all men to be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> And, <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Chriſt gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felfe a ranſome for all.</hi> Alſo that to <hi>Titus, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>The grace of God, that bringeth ſaluation vnto all men, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared:</hi> But that here, by <hi>all,</hi> are vnderſtood <hi>any;</hi> and men, of whatſoeuer ſtate and condition, the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:11390:134"/>and coherence of the place doth proue. In that place to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the Apoſtle would haue Kings to be prayed for; in that place to <hi>Titus,</hi> hee commandeth ſeruants to be faithfull, and not to purlome. Of this exhortation, this is the <hi>cauſe and reaſon;</hi> becauſe the promiſe of ſaluation did belong to Kings, although at that time they were ſtrangers from Chriſt; and to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, although they were of an abiect and baſe ſtate; neither is any condition of men excluded from ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth thus take this place of the firſt to <hi>Timothy, Enchirid. ad Laurent. Cap.</hi> 103. And <hi>Thomas</hi> in his commentary vpon this Epiſtle. And this thing is confirmed by the very words of the Apoſtle; for he ſaith, <hi>God would haue all men be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> Now it is manifeſt by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that God doth not giue, yea, nor doth not offer to all and particular men the knowledge of the truth.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is frequent in the Scripture, to take the word <hi>all,</hi> for the word <hi>any,</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 12.42. <hi>Ye tithe Mint and Rue,</hi> &amp; omneolus, <hi>and all manner of hearbs.</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.35. <hi>Chriſt healed,</hi> omnem morbum, <hi>euery diſeaſe,</hi> for <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery kinde of diſeaſe.</hi> You haue the like example, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.28. In this ſenſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. Chriſt is ſaid to haue dyed for all.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Furthermore, there is no doubt, but that the Apoſtle commandeth vs to pray, not onely for Kings in generall, but alſo for all ſeuerall Kings. For we, to whom the ſecrets of Election are vnknowne, ought to hope well of euery one: But he that commandeth vs to pray for <hi>Nero,</hi> doth not therefore determine that God will ſaue <hi>Nero,</hi> but onely forbiddeth vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of him.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:11390:134"/>
               <p n="7">VII. The ſenſe therefore of theſe words, <hi>God would haue all men to be ſaued;</hi> is this: <hi>God doth inuite men of all ſorts to ſaluation, and doth exclude no condition of men from ſaluation.</hi> For if God ſhould abſolutely will, or ſhould ſeriouſly deſire all and particular men to be ſaued, there would not be wanting meanes to him, whereby he might effect what hee would, and be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his deſire, his iuſtice yet remaining intire, and mans liberty being not touched, nor infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That place maketh no more to the purpoſe, which they bring out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Deſtroy not him with thy meate, for whom Chriſt dyed:</hi> For to deſtroy there, is not to condemne, but to ſcandalize and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the conſcience of any; by which deede, as much as is in vs, we would lead him to deſtruction: For to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy any one abſolutely, is not in our power. So with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. <hi>to deſtroy,</hi> is the ſame thing, as to offend with ſcandall, and to ſlacken him that is doing the workes of piety.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. In the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>Peter, Chap</hi> 2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. Chriſt is ſaid to haue redeemed the falſe Prophets, who denyed him: but there it is not ſpoken of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from eternall death, but of the freedome from ignorance and errour, and the darkeneſſe of that age, by the light of the Goſpell, which thoſe falſe Prophets did corrupt, by the mingling of falſe doctrine: For to take redemption for any kinde of freedome, is vſuall in the Scripture; inſomuch, that reſurrection is called the redemption of our bodies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30.</p>
               <p n="10">X. In the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:11390:135"/>
                  <hi>God is not willing that any ſhould periſh:</hi> to wit, becauſe he is not the cauſe of the periſhing of any one; and becauſe he admitteth all who are conuerted, neither doth he reiect any one: But he is not bound to reſtore to all, thoſe powers which were loſt by mans fault, nor to giue faith to all, ſeeing man by his owne fault brought vpon himſelfe the inability of beleeuing, as wee haue proued at large in the eleauenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 18.23. God ſaith theſe words; <hi>I am not delighted with the death of a ſinner, but that he ſhould be conuerted, and liue.</hi> Theſe words ſay nothing elſe, then that God will not the death of that ſinner who is conuerted: But if he be not conuerted, <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe will not deny, but that God doth will his death; as the Iudge doth will the puniſhment of him that is gui ty. God is not delighted with the death of a ſinner, as hee is a man, but yet no man can deny, but that God loueth the execution of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Indeede in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. God is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the ſauiour of all men.</hi> But the Apoſtle there ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the preſeruation in this preſent life, and of the prouidence of God, which is extended to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of all men: which care, <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 36. doth extend euen to the beaſts, for there God is called the preſeruer of men and beaſts. The precedent words of the Apoſtle doth declare this: <hi>We hope in the liuing God;</hi> for he ſpeaketh of God, as he doth giue life to things created by him. Alike place you haue, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.25.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Arminius, pag.</hi> 220. againſt <hi>Perkins,</hi> doth bring the promiſe made to <hi>Adam,</hi> concerning the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:11390:135"/>ſeede of the Woman, which ſaith hee, doth belong to all particular men. I anſwere, that by this promiſe it is onely promiſed that Sathan ſhall be ouercome, by the ſeede of the Woman; but that it belongeth to all and particular men, it is no where ſaid. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> doth not ſo pertaine to all his poſteritie, as the precepts of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall law; becauſe the obedience of the law is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall debt; but the doctrine of the Goſpell is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall remedy. Thence it is that the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> againſt the law of God, is imputed to all his poſteritie; but his faith, by which he beleeued the Goſpell, is not imputed to his poſteritie. Nor if <hi>Adam,</hi> by his incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie, had refuſed the promiſe of the ſeede of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, had therefore his poſteritie fell from the hope of ſaluation: Nay, what that this promiſe of the ſeede of the Woman, to breake the Serpents head, is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtrained to the faithfull alone? For Sathan doth bruiſe the heele of the children of God alone, ſeeing he killeth the reſt with a deadly wound.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The <hi>Arminians</hi> being driuen from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, flie to their reaſons: and as they vſe the Scripture without reaſon, ſo they vrge reaſons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture.

               </q>
               <p>The minor part of this Syllogiſme is falſe, and doth beare many exceptions For they to whom Chriſt hath not beene preached, and who haue heard nothing of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:11390:136"/>the death of Chriſt, are not bound to beleeue that Chriſt dyed for them, which yet are the greateſt part of the world: Neither are they, to whom Chriſt is preached, bound to beleeue abſolutely and without condition that Chriſt died for them, but on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if they be conuerted: For if they ſhall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in impenitency, they are bound to beleeue that the death of Chriſt doth nothing pertaine to them.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. <hi>Arminius, pag.</hi> 77. againſt <hi>Perkins,</hi> and his ſectaries, doe repeate and heape vp theſe things, euen to tediouſneſſe. <hi>If there be any, for whoſe ſinnes God would not haue ſatisfaction to be made to himſelfe by the death of Chriſt, then in no right can faith be required of them, nor can Chriſt be made their iudge, neither can the reprobate be blamed for refuſing the grace of redemption, becauſe it did not pertaine to him.</hi> I anſwere, all theſe things are grounded on this falſe ſuppoſition, that faith is required of all men: for wee haue already taught, that it is not required of them who neuer had any meanes to know Chriſt; as alſo that they to whom Chriſt is preached, are not bound abſolutely and without condition, to beleeue that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the death of Chriſt, but on this condition, that they be conuerted. They to whom the Goſpell hath not beene preached, ſhall not be condemned for the reiection of the Goſpell, but for the breach of the Law: of which iudgement, Chriſt by his father is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the Iudge; who doth leaue vnder the Law, thoſe whom he doth not ſaue by the Goſpell. But they who by their incredulity, haue refuſed the grace offred them by the Goſpell, are iuſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:11390:136"/>for refuſing that grace, not becauſe they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected that which pertaineth to vnbeleeuers and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent perſons, but becauſe hauing deſpiſed the condition, they haue neglected that which was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them vnder the condition of beleeuing; which condition, although they cannot fulfill by their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall powers, yet it is their debt, for man himſelfe, by his owne fault, brought vpon himſelfe the diſabilitie of beleeuing, which diſability God is not bound to cure in all: Of which thing it is largely ſpoken, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. But (ſay they) Reprobates cannot be blamed for deſpiſing that grace which doth not belong vnto them. But they are quite out of the way: For repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates cannot be accuſed for deſpiſing grace, if they did deſpiſe it, becauſe they knew it did not belong vnto them: But they therefore reiect it, becauſe they loue not Chriſt, and they are led to the contempt of it by their owne will: For Reprobates doe not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beleeue, becauſe ſaluation doth not belong vnto them; but rather, ſaluation doth not belong vnto them, becauſe they doe not beleeue, and they draw deſtruction to themſelues, by their owne incredulity and impenitency.

The ſaluation of man was the end God propounded to himſelfe; that this was the end is hence manifeſt, becauſe this is laſt in execution: Therefore God firſt thought of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſaluation, before he thought of the obtayning of ſaluation by Chriſt, becauſe this is the meanes by which he doth leade vs to ſaluation.</p>

And when they ſpeake of the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the death of Chriſt, as they extoll the efficacy of it, ſo they ſay that it is ſufficient, not onely for men, but alſo for the diuells. Which if it be true, it muſt needes be, that God doth take away and cut off ſomething from the price of the death of his Sonne; and doth ſhorten the <hi>efficacy</hi> of it. But although I know that the price and dignity of the death of Chriſt, doth not depend on his humane nature, but on the infinite excellency of his diuine nature, yet I denie that his death is fit for the redemption of diuels, becauſe the iuſtice of God requireth, that man who ſinned, ſhould beare the puniſhment, and it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that the mediator betweene God and man <hi>ſhould haue reference</hi> to both, in the communion of his nature: Therefore to ſaue man, <hi>he tooke not the Angels, but the ſeede of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. And if the death of a man is ſit to ſatisfie for the ſinnes of Angels, then the torments of an Angell, if Chriſt had taken the nature of Angells, had beene fit to ſatisfie for the ſinnes of man. Finally, when it is ſpoken of the fitneſſe, is not to be diſputed of the ſufficiency: For otherwiſe, it might alſo be diſputed whether the death of Chriſt be ſufficient to ſaue Horſes or Beetles, and to giue them immortality; which ſurely is not without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie.</p>

Theſe in a manner are the arguments wherwith theſe innouators do defend themſelus: But they doe exagitate and wrong our opinion, after their owne manner, which is euill; for they change it before they impugne it: By this meanes they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute our opinion, but their owne forgeries. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſake, Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.17. ſpeaketh thus: <hi>God ſent not his ſonne into the world, to condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſaued. Greuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chouius, Page</hi> 21. doth faigne that wee thus interprete this place: <hi>God ſent his Sonne into the Elect;</hi> When notwithſtanding there, by the world, is manifeſtly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this region of the earth, and his habitation among men.

Behold the mans</hi> paſtime, and his Theologicall ſpleene. I doe not doubt but his heart leapt for ioy when hee writ theſe things, as a thing brauely carried: But the good man doth trifle, and fight with his owne ſhadow, for theſe things doe quite differ from our opinion. For we doe not command the Reprobates, <hi>that is,</hi> they that perſeuere in impenitency &amp; vnbeleefe, to beleeue
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:11390:138"/>a lie, or while they perſeuere in impenitency, to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelues with a vaine hope, vnder the pretence of faith in Chriſt: Nor doe we ſay that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to eternall puniſhments for no deſert of theirs, ſeeing they haue procured this deſtruction to themſelues by their owne ſinnes: Nor doe we teach that any one is onely therefore called by God, that he might procure to himſelfe greater iudgement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though oftentimes, men by their calling are made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, becauſe by the knowledge of their dutie, the fault of the neglect of their duty is made greater, and it is a greater fault, not to doe what you know. then not to know what you ſhould doe. The ſcope and intent of God calling to the Reprobates, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them that which they owe; to the elect is, to giue the efficacy of their calling, that they might be ſaued; to them both, that hee might make knowne what is acceptable to him, and what obedience is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him.</p>

But <hi>Greuinchouius</hi> ſhall not goe ſcot-free, it ſeemeth good to lay theſe things vpon him, and to preſent to your view the prodigious doctrine of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> the curtaine being, as it were, drawne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and that without any falſe accuſation: For put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the perſon of an <hi>Arminian,</hi> I may thus ſpeake to the Reprobates. <q>Be of a good courage ye Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, for although ye are reprobates, yet ye may be ſaued. It is true indeede that no reprobates are ſaued; but yet there is none of them who may not be ſaued. For Chriſt hath obtained for you ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not the application of ſaluation: He hath obtained good things for you, but hee hath not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:11390:139"/>for you, that you ſhould euer poſſeſſe thoſe good things in act: For he hath obtained that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, which in the very moment wherein he procured it, he certainly knew would not profit you. Hee hath obtained for you the remiſſion of thoſe ſinnes which he certainely knew were not to be remitted: For this reconciliation is not applied but on a condition which hee knew was not to be fulfilled. And that ye may know how well Chriſt wiſheth you, I tell you that hee doth intercede for you with a generall interceſſion, but not with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, without which no man is ſaued. For by the death of Chriſt, reconciliation is obtained for you, but not the communication of the reconciliation: Neither is the application of the obtained reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation procured for you; but God by it hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to himſelfe liberty and faculty to ſaue you: By which death, Chriſt is made a redeemer, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certaine purpoſe of God who were to be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and is made the head of the Church, without any members that are certaine. God indeede ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Sonne into the world, was moued with ſome inclination and affection towards men; but without any certaine will of ſauing men: For the decree of ſending his Sonne, went in order before the decree of ſauing. By which decree, all men are elected, although many from eternity were repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. God indeede did deſire to ſaue all and that ſeriouſly, but he is diſappointed of his end by you, neither hath hee attained to what hee did deſire, which doth very much grieue him. Know alſo this, O reprobates, that Chriſt procured and purchaſed
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:11390:139"/>ſaluation for you all, but he is not willing it ſhould be knowne but to ſome few, when yet without this knowledge no man can be ſaued. Alſo although he hath obtained reconciliation for you, yet hee hath not obtained faith for you, without which there is no ſaluation: Wherefore God calleth you to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but not after a congruent and agreeable manner, whereby they that are called doe not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And yet be not out of heart, God giueth to you all the power of beleeuing, that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeu in act, if ye wil, for it is in the powr of your own free-will to vſe grace, or not to vſe it, that ye may be ſaued, although certainly you are to be damned.</q> Kindely ſpoken; yea, rather wickedly ſpoken, and to the ſcorne of God and men: For who doth not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the ſhape of ſo prodigious a doctrine? Who doth not grieue at the caſe of the Chriſtian Church, to the deforming of which, and to the turning of it into a monſter, <hi>no ſlow wits</hi> haue conuerted all their ſubtlety? When therfore <hi>Greuiuchouius, Page</hi> 70. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touched with pitty towards vs, doth profeſſe that he is ready to helpe our infirmity and ignorance, it is a doubt whether he be worthier of laughter, or of pitty.</p>

               <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He queſtion whereby it is demanded whether God doth equally loue all men, and ſo deſire their ſaluation, is an addition to the former queſtion, and doth depend on it: For if remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes and ſaluation are not purchaſed for all men by the death of Chriſt, it is plaine that all men are not equally loued by God: wherefore theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uators doe defend themſelues in either queſtion, by the ſame places of Scripture. Theſe are the words of <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 379 <hi>God, in a generall will and affection, doth equally deſire the ſaluation of all men. Greuinchoui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, pag.</hi> 335. doth conſent to this: <hi>The will of God, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:11390:141"/>his affection of ſauing men, is equall towards all.</hi> For in that ſeries and order of the foure decrees, in which they comprehend the whole doctrine of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, this is the third; that God decreed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to all men ſufficient meanes to faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>But I ſuppoſe that theſe things are affirmed by them, not becauſe they beleeue, and ſeriouſly thinke ſo, but that they might maintaine their other opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which cannot ſtand, if this opinion fall: for they doe openly repugne the Scripture, experience, yea, and themſelues.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Which before we demonſtrate, the reader is to be admoniſhed, that loue in God is not an affection, nor paſſion, nor inclination of the minde, nor any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; for God is not touched by theſe paſſions, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impaſſible, and not ſubiect to affections: But as God is ſaid then to be angry or to hate, when he will puniſh or deſtroy; ſo loue in God is a eertaine and ſure will of doing good to the creature. Whence it commeth to paſſe, that hee may rightly be ſaid to be loued by God, to whom hee hath giuen or hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to giue more and better good things.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This difference is manifeſtly ſeene, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betweene the good and the euill, but alſo betweene good men themſelues, to ſome one of whom God hath giuen more vnderſtanding, and doth meaſure out his ſpirit in a larger &amp; greater meaſure; but to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſparingly, and as it were with a ſtriked mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: to one he giueth two talents, to another fiue, according to his owne good pleaſure: Not onely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many things to the beſt men, but alſo making

God is vnaptly ſaid to hope for that which himſelfe is to worke. Theſe ſubtill men are wont to ſay, when they are vrged, that theſe things are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by an <hi>Anthropopathy</hi> to mans capacity; but in the meane while, they abuſe theſe improper words, to bring in their owne ſpeculations, and to build vp their owne opinions. In preaching and ſpeaking to the people, this impropriety of ſpeech is to be borne with, but not in diſputing, and when the importance of truth is to be conſidered and weighed.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Concerning this inequality of the gifts of God, I would haue the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſhew me, why God hath giuen more gifts to <hi>Paul,</hi> then to <hi>Marke</hi> or <hi>Cleophas,</hi> that were otherwiſe holy and good men: Was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before his conuerſion, was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the faith of Chriſt, and better affected then they? Or becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> vſed that common and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grace, which happeneth euen to the reprobates, better then <hi>Marke?</hi> Theſe are trifles; for there was then none more deadly enemie to the name of Chriſt, then <hi>Paul.</hi> What then was the cauſe? why, becauſe it ſo ſeemed good to God, who doth with his owne what he will; and who in diſtributing the gifts of the holy Ghoſt doth not follow an Arithmeticall or Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:11390:142"/>proportion; for he doth giue vnequall good things to them that are equally euill, according to his owne pleaſure, as being a debtor to no man, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any Law.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But the difference and inequality of the loue of God, will more clearely appeare, if thoſe whom God doth call by his word, and to whom he doth giue the ſpirit of adoption, and faith, and by them ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be compared with other men: <hi>Many</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.4.) <hi>are called, few choſen.</hi> Behold here three ſorts of men: ſome that are not called; ſome that are called, and not elected; ſome that are called and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: all which, that they are confuſedly and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued, and that God doth alike deſire their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot be ſaid or thought.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44. ſaith: <hi>No man can come to me, vnleſſe my father which ſent me, draw him.</hi> Where that it is ſpoken of the drawing to faith, and by faith to ſaluation, no man doth doubt. Secing therefore by theſe words it is manifeſt, that all are not ſo drawne; it is certaine that they are moſt loued, who are ſo drawne. Faith is the gift of God, but all men haue not faith, and it is giuen but to few; therefore theſe are more loued: So the ſpirit of Adoption is a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of the ſonnes of God, therefore alſo theſe are more loued.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Doth not God viſite ſome people from on high, and doth vouchſafe them the preaching of his word, others being neglected? as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. ſaying, <hi>God in times paſt ſuffred the Gentiles to walke in their owne wayes.</hi> At this time alſo there are very many nations drowned in deepe darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

               <p n="12">XII. When Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.16. that he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſheep which he hath not yet gathered: did he loue thoſe ſheepe which were not yet gathered, but were to be gathered in his time, no more then other men, whom he hath not onely not drawne by his word, but not ſo much as vouchſafed to call? Surely if God did equally will the ſaluation of all and ſingular men, he would equally ſupply to all men the meanes of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and he would not giue to many people onely a <hi>ſhadowed</hi> light, and ſuch meanes, by which being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the <hi>Arminians</hi> themſelues haue not yet da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to affirme that any man hath come to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Notable is that of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. where he giueth thanks to his father, that he hath hidden the doctrine of ſaluation from the wiſe, and had reuealed it to babes. But why? did he as much loue them from whom he had hid the doctrine of ſaluation? <hi>Arnold. pag</hi> 413 <hi>&amp;</hi> 414. doth depraue and corrupt the words of Chriſt: For he will haue Chriſt to giue thankes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his father had reuealed to babes thoſe things which were hidden from men of vnderſtanding: But Chriſt doth not onely ſay, that theſe things were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from the wiſe, but doth expreſly ſay, that God hid theſe things from them.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. That place of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9. doth trouble the Sectaries, where it is ſaid, that God loued <hi>Iacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> before they had done good, or

               <p n="15">XV. The <hi>Arminians</hi> doe couer themſelues againſt this ſhower of Arguments, with that their diſtinction of the antecedent and conſequent will of God. They ſay that God doth loue ſome men more then other by his conſequent will, <hi>that is,</hi> by that will which is after the faith and repentance of man: For God doth loue them moſt, whom he fore ſeeth will beleeue, and by their owne free-will, are to vſe grace well. But by his primary and antecedent will, God doth alike loue all men, and doth equally deſire the ſaluation of all; and therefore he doth giue to all men ſufficient grace for faith, and ſo for ſaluation. And the cauſe why the Goſpell is not preached to all, they ſay, is not the will of God, but either the negligence of Chriſtians, or the indignity and vnworthineſſe of the people, or elſe the ſinnes of their anceſtors, who haue reiected grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Certainely this is a deadly ſpeech, and is
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:11390:144"/>directly contrary, not onely to the Scripture, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to it ſelfe. For while they bring reaſons, why God doth not offer his Goſpell to all, vnawares they yeeld to our party; for they lay downe the cauſes, why God doth not equally loue all: But the queſtion is not, why God loueth ſome men more then others, but whether God doth loue all men equally; therefore they entangle themſelues. And how abſurd that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is of the will of God into antecedent and conſequent, how contumelious againſt God, in that ſence in which it is taken by the ſectaries, wee haue taught at large, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. Moreouer, they teach, that God is often diſappointed of his antecedent will, and that the loue of God to vs is then mutable, if he loue vs with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent will, <hi>that is,</hi> by his will which is after our loue and faith, and our owne will. <hi>It is a wicked thing to deſire,</hi> that the immutability of the loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, ſhould be after our loue, and ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on our will; for the loue of God cannot be certaine, if it be grounded on the loue wherewith we firſt loue him. That therefore the loue of God to vs might be certaine and immutable, it muſt needes goe before our loue, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth, 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Ye loue him, becauſe he loued you firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. And if God by his conſequent will loued one man more then another, becauſe hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw hee would beleeue, and vſe grace well; then God ſhall not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="19">XIX. Then alſo that ſpeech of the Apoſtle will faile, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy;</hi> if the will of man doth goe before the will of God, whereby hee will certainly and immutably haue mercy vpon vs. For the <hi>Arminians</hi> teach, that the antecedent will of God may be reſiſted, but his conſequent will cannot. It muſt needes be therefore, that they ſay that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh of the conſequent will, and of that loue whereby God loueth vs by his conſequent will, ſeeing that the Apoſtle doth there adde, <hi>Who hath reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his will?</hi> And truely here the good men are held, intangled with a knot, from which they will neuer vnloſe themſelues. For if they ſay that the Apoſtle in this place doth ſpeake of the antecedent will of God, which may be reſiſted, then they fall foule vpon that which is there ſaid, <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> But if they will haue it to be ſpoken of the conſequent will of God (which is grounded on the will of man, and the right vſing of grace, and is after our will) they are refuted by that other ſpeech of the Apoſtle, <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> But Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> doth directly teach here, that the will of man, and the fore-ſeeing of the right vſe of grace and of faith (which the will of hauing mercy ſhould follow) is excluded by this will of God which cannot be reſiſted.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. Let the <hi>Arminians</hi> tell me why God loued <hi>Iacob</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau</hi> before they had done eyther good or euill: Surely he was not preferred before him by the Conſequent will of God, and which was after the faith or workes of <hi>Iacob;</hi> ſeeing that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:11390:145"/>doth directly remoue from the election according to the purpoſe of God, the conſideration of all good which they eyther had done or were to do; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhould ſpeak <hi>vnproperly</hi> if he ſhould exclude on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the conſideration of the good done before his birth, and not the conſideration of the good which <hi>Iacob</hi> was afterward to doe, ſeeing no man was ignorant that <hi>Iacob</hi> could not doe any good before his birth: Yea, if he could haue done, yet the fore-ſeeing of the good to be done after his birth, would no leſſe dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the election of free grace, then the fore-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the good which ſhould goe before his birth. And if God electing had had reſpect to the good which <hi>Iacob</hi> was to doe, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would not haue appeaſed him that pleadeth with God, and doth ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly enquire; ſeeing that the reaſon had beene ready, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the one was preferred before the other, becauſe God fore-ſaw the faith and workes of the one. Finally that ſpeech, <hi>It is not of him that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, nor of him that runneth,</hi> doth exclude all indeauour and helpe of man from the cauſes of election, and of the good will of God, by which he vnchangeably hath mercy vpon man.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. But thoſe examples and teſtimonies which we haue brought out of the Scripture, doe no leſſe eſtabliſh the inequality of the loue of God, by his antecedent will, then by his conſequent will. For when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>No man can come to me, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe my father draw him,</hi> hee ſpeaketh of the calling which goeth before faith, and which is peculiar but to ſome men. The ſame is to be iudged of the other examples. For what? Did God, preaching to the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:11390:145"/>Iewes, and not to the men of <hi>Tire,</hi> leſſe loue the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians then the Iewes, by his conſequent will, <hi>that is,</hi> becauſe he ſaw that the Tyrians were worſe affected, and that they were leſſe diſpoſed to beleeue, then the Iewes? No ſure, for Chriſt doth contrarily teſtifie that the Tyrians were more prone to repentance then the Iewes.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Had the <hi>Corinthians</hi> or <hi>Romanes</hi> that liued in the age of the Apoſtles, more inclination to faith then their anceſtors that liued an hundred yeers before? Did God not vouchſafe the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Epheſians,</hi> who liued a little before the birth of Chriſt, becauſe their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had refuſed it? But if this were the cauſe, why then did he inlighten with his ſauing doctrine their children, which proceeded from the ſame anceſtors? Surely becauſe it ſo ſeemed good to God, who for his owne goodneſſe doth beſtow more benefits vpon them whom hee loueth mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="23">XXIII. But why did God call <hi>Paul</hi> with ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a calling, in the very <hi>height</hi> of his hatred againſt the Church, and of a wolfe made him a ſheep, of a ſheep a ſhepheard? was it done becauſe God perceiued in him ſome inclination to faith in Chriſt? Or becauſe he did well vſe vniuerſall grace? No ſure: For at that time, like a Tyger, hee raged againſt the fould of Chriſt. But God did not loue him any whit the more by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent will, <hi>that is,</hi> for the fore-ſeeing of faith, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the faith of <hi>Paul</hi> was an effect of the loue of God: Nor was he loued becauſe he was to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:11390:146"/>but that he might be faithfull; as he himſelfe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. where he ſaith, <hi>That he obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that he might be faithfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. And ſeeing as it commeth to paſſe, that God doth beſtow vpon a man that is euill, and borne of bad parents, more of his grace and gifts, and doth effectually conuert him, that where ſinne doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, there grace might abound. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. I would know whether God would be more liberall to an euill man, by his antecedent, or by his conſequent will: If by his antecedent will, we haue ouercome; if by his conſequent will, let the <hi>Arminians</hi> tell me, what will of the euill man went before his effectuall calling, which could not be found in another which is leſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? Will they ſay, that he that was more euill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conuerſion, did thirſt, <hi>was but a little euill,</hi> and did the will of his father, as they ſpeake? They ſhall more eaſily draw oyle out of a pumiſe ſtone, then they ſhall finde in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before his conuerſion; in the theefe before his crucifying; or in them to whom, for a heart of ſtone God giueth a heart of fleſh, any ſuch diſpoſitions, before regeneration.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. Adde to theſe, that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16. <hi>God in times past ſuffered all nations to walke in their owne waies.</hi> Here I demand whether God did ſo much loue theſe nations, and did alike wiſh their ſaluation, as he loued their poſteritie, whom he afterward called with an effectuall calling by his Goſpell. I ſuppoſe, that no man hath ſo brazen a face, that he dareth affirme it: Neither doe the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> deny, but that the ſauing calling by the Goſpell, is a very great argument of the loue of God to any
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:11390:146"/>nation: But hauing bent their diſputation another way, they doe ſearch into the cauſes, why God doth more vehemently loue ſome then others, which is that very thing which we would haue.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. Finally, if God doth equally will to all men the end, <hi>that is,</hi> ſaluation, then alſo hee will equally ſuggeſt vnto them the meanes to the end, <hi>to wit,</hi> the word, faith, and the ſpirit: But he doth not ſuggeſt theſe things equally to all; neither can any thing be imagined more abſurd, then that God ſhould equally will, that all particular men ſhould beleeue, and be ſaued, and yet ſuggeſt to ſome men the meanes that are congruent and fit, and will certainely profit; but to others, meanes that are not congruent nor fit, and that certainely will not profit, which yet is the doctrine of <hi>Arminius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. And in ſetting downe the cauſes of the greater loue of God towards ſome one nation, and his leſſe loue towards ſome other, it cannot be ſaid how coldly they deale: Sometimes they make the diſpoſition of the one, which is better then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be the cauſe; which we deny. For <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Corinth,</hi> or <hi>Epheſus,</hi> were not more prone to piety a little before the light of the Goſpell was brought to them, then they were ſome ages before: Yea, at that time, prodigious luſt, riot, pride, and rapine, had ſo immeaſurably increaſed, that they could goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At the ſame time there were many nations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſtupid with their barbarous lewdneſſe, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more worthy of pitty, if the heauenly calling were gouerned by mans reaſon, and not by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret purpoſe of God. Surely before the comming of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:11390:147"/>Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> God had much people at <hi>Corinth,</hi> as God himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.10. and that among the moſt foule and common luſts of that moſt impure citie: For which elects ſake, God in his appointed time, ſent to <hi>Corinth</hi> ſuch an excellent Apoſtle, ſo cleere a trumpet of the Goſpell, whoſe preaching and miracles he vſed, to the conuerſion of them who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his election.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. Finally, ſeeing that there is no man, who by himſelfe, and of his owne nature, is not vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to faith and conuerſion, no man that is not dead in ſinne; no man that is not vnable to follow God calling: He is ridiculous, who in the worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and ſpirituall reſurrection, doth ſeeke for diſpoſitions and inclinations to life, among the dead, and who doth faigne that God hath a will of ſauing vs, which doth follow mans free-will, and doth depend on it.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. But to make the fault of their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to be cauſe of this, and to thinke that God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not haue his Goſpell to be preached to this nation, becauſe their anceſtors, a thouſand, or two thouſand yeers before, refuſed the grace of God, <hi>is abſurd, and nothing</hi> to the purpoſe: For the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that liued in the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> were ſprung of the ſame anceſtors which the <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, which liued thirty or forty yeeres before the preaching of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> Nor is it equall that the ofspring ſhould be puniſhed for the ſinnes of their anceſtors: <hi>The ſonne ſhall not beare the iniquity of the father, Ezechiel</hi> 18. Nor doth the law extend the viſitation of the fathers vpon the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:11390:147"/>children, beyond the third and fourth generation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though alſo there it is ſpoken of children that ſhall walke in the ſteppes of their fathers, and doe imitate their fathers wickedneſſe. Further alſo by warres, by colonies and companies, by baniſhments, and by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, there is a maruailous permixtion and mingling together of mankinde, and in one and the ſame nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are ſome who haue proceeded from other anceſtors, whoſe manners were diuers: Yea, one and the ſame man hath proceeded from anceſtors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome haue refuſed the grace of God, and ſome haue not: Of all which, if regard is to be had; &amp; if God will haue his Goſpell preached, or not preached to a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according as their anceſtors haue behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, it will be impoſſible but that he muſt be diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with diuers and contrary thoughts, and that his wiſedome muſt be bound with ridiculous bonds, and contrary purpoſes.</p>
               <p n="30">XXX. Yet the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their opinion, and although they know, that in all ages, and ſee that in this our age, the name of Chriſt is vnknowne to many nations; yet they doe harden their minde, and doe contend, that God would haue the Goſpell to be preached to all. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus, Page</hi> 97. doth deny that it may be ſaid, that God would not haue the Goſpell to be preached to all. And, <hi>Page</hi> 397. <hi>It is true indeede</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Goſpell is not euery where preached to all, yet it doth not thence follow, that God will not bring all men to faith, but this happeneth becauſe by their owne affected malice and peruerſity, they make themſelues vnworthy of that Grace:</hi> Which words doe ſeeme to mee to imply a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:11390:148"/>contradiction, for if the cauſe why the Goſpell is not preached to a nation, is the wickedneſſe and prauity of it, it is playne that God will not haue his Goſpell preached to that nation, becauſe by this puniſhment he would reuenge the ſtubbornneſſe and obſtinacy of it. And to think that any puniſhments are inflicted on any nations, God being vnwilling, eſpecially in the worke of our ſaluation, is to accuſe God of cruell negligence, and to deſire to put out the eyes of his prouidence: Alſo wee haue largely taught that all men are vnworthy, and that, (God ſo diſpenſing) the Goſpell is preached to the moſt vnworthy, and to the worſt nations: According to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.20. <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not, I was made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to them that asked not after me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">XXXI. Being driuen therfore from hence, they haue deuiſed another thing, then which, nothing is more weake. They ſay that it cannot be ſaid, that God is vnwilling that the Goſpell ſhould be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all nations, but that many nations ſit in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe there are wanting thoſe who wil preach to them, and that this commeth to paſſe, becauſe the zeale of Chriſtians doth grow cold, and becauſe of the ſloathfulneſſe of the paſtors of the Church, who will not goe thither to preach: But if all Chriſtians were affected as it is meete they ſhould, and were touched with a zeale of the houſe of God, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell would be wanting to no people. I anſwere, that I am not hee who will affirme that Chriſtians are altogether faultleſſe in this thing: Yet notwithſtanding it cannot be doubted, but that theſe things are gouerned by the counſell and prouidence
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:11390:148"/>of God. For if God would haue brought the light of the Goſpell to the people of <hi>America,</hi> who haue lyen for many ages in the thicke night of ignorance, be had not ſuffered them for ſo many ages, to be vnknowne to the Chriſtian world. For how can they be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for not preaching the Goſpell to the <hi>Americans,</hi> who did not know that there were any ſuch people, or that that prat of the earth was inhabited? Neither is it credible that God can be diſappointed of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and of his deſire of ſauing any Nation, by the negligence of ſome Miniſters: Nor is it equall, that enumerable people ſhould for euer beare the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others negligence. Alſo if God would haue his Goſpell preached to people, who are diuided from vs in land, climate, and language, he would haue infuſed into ſome of vs, the gift of tongues, that they might be vnderſtood by the Barbarians: But at this day, the <hi>Americans</hi> are inſtructed in Popery, in the Spaniſh tongue, to the learning of which, they are compelled by force: therefore they haue vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued religion with the language; ſo that to know Chriſt, is to them a kinde of puniſhment, and a part of their bondage, which the calling of God doth abhorre. But it is an eaſie thing for theſe inuouators (while in this great peace and quietneſſe, they make worke for themſelues and others) to talke of theſe things in corners; who if they ſpoke ſeriouſly, would forthwith in companies ſayle into <hi>America</hi> or <hi>Florida,</hi> or would goe to the inhabitants of the South conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and would haue inſtructed them in the faith of Chriſt; and would not (being forgetfull of the croſſe of Chriſt, and being ouertaken with the itching of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:11390:149"/>their owne wit) haue made ſo many troubles, nor haue torne the bowels of their owne Church.</p>
               <p n="32">XXXII. But it is wont to be diſputed, whether the Apoſtles preached to all men: Surely it doth not ſeeme to me to be likely, that the Apoſtles paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Aequinoctiall, into the inmoſt parts of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke,</hi> or that they came into <hi>America,</hi> or any other part of the world which is vnknowne: The ſhort life of the Apoſtles was not ſufficient for that worke, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the way knowne to theſe places; alſo ſome prints and ſignes of Chriſtianity would be extant there. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe iournyes and courſes were well knowne, had falſely ſaid, that hee had laboured more then all the Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. if the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had gone to the Antipodes, or to the Articke and Antarticke Pole. The memory of all ages doth witneſſe, that there hath beene more Heathens then Chriſtians, and that the Chriſtian Church, where it was moſt flouriſhing, ſcarce poſſeſſed the tithe or tenth part of the earth. The Apoſtles indeede were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to preach the Goſpell to euery creature, but this commandement doth not belong to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles alone, but alſo to their ſucceſſors, who haue or ſhall carry this lampe of the Goſpell, deliuered to them by their predeceſſors, through the whole world. For the Goſpell muſt be preached to all nations, yet not together, and at the ſame time, but ſucceſſiuely. If that ſpeach, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>Their ſound went through the whole earth,</hi> be applyed to the preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, yet it will not neceſſarily follow, that this muſt be at once, and at the ſame moment, rather then by parts, and ſucceſſiuely: God, as it were viewing and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:11390:149"/>going about the Nations, vntill there ſhall be none, to whom the doctrine of ſaluation hath not at length come: no otherwiſe then the Sun in the <hi>Aequinoctiall</hi> day, doth not enlighten the whole Globe of the earth at one time, but by parts, vntill he hath finiſhed his courſe. For then ſhall the end of the world be neare, when the Goſpell hath come to all people; as Chriſt himſelfe witneſſeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.14. <hi>And the Goſpell of the kingdome ſhall be preached in all the world, for a witneſſe vnto all Nations, and then ſhall the end be:</hi> which words of our Sauiour doe cut this knot; for it is manifeſt, that in the time of the Apoſtles, the Goſpell was not preached to all Nations, becauſe at that time the end was not neare.</p>
               <p n="33">XXXIII. But (ſay you) Saint <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 1.23. doth ſay, <hi>that the Goſpell was preached to euery creature which is vnder heauen.</hi> I anſwere: The Apoſtles vſeth a kinde of ſpeech vſuall in the Scriptures, which by all that are vnder heauen, doe not vnderſtand all and euery particular creature, abſolutely and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but very many of them: So, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3. <hi>And there were dwelling at Ieruſalem Iewes, out of euery nation vnder heauen.</hi> For what? were there ſome out of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> or out of the <hi>Molucoes,</hi> or the South contenent, the names of which places were not then knowne? much leſſe, that they ſhould come from thence to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: So, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.15. <hi>I ſaw all the liuing, which walke vnder the ſunne;</hi> When yet <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaw onely a little part of the earth.

               <p n="34">XXXIV. That I may not ſay many things: In this queſtion, whether God doth equally deſire the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of all men, and whether he doth loue all men with an equall loue; the truth is ſo euident, that the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſometimes are aſhamed of themſelues, and vnawares doe come to our ſide. <hi>Arminius</hi> againſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, p.</hi> 2.4. hath theſe words: <hi>If any one, by the helpe of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar grace, hath apprehended grace offred; it is thence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that God doth loue him with a greater loue then he doth another, to whom he hath only made his grace common, but hath denied his peculiar grace. Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 380. doth confeſſe, that <hi>Arminius</hi> doth acknowledge, that the meanes to faith, are not ſufficiently offered to all men; all men therefore are not loued alike: Neither is any thing ſo frequent with the <hi>Arminians,</hi> as to ſay, that God calleth ſome men in a congruent and fit time and manner, by which, they that are called, doe certainly &amp; infallibly follow him calling;

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:11390:150"/>opinion of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> that God doth giue that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall grace to all, which may be effectuall in act, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man beleeueth, nor no man is ſaued: and that God doth giue but to few that grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he giues, not onely to be able, but alſo to will, &amp; to deſire to be conuerted and beleeue. God therefore doth more deſire the ſaluation of theſe men, then of others, to whom hee doth not vouchſafe this benefit.</p>
               <p n="35">XXXV. Notable aboue the reſt, are the words of <hi>Greuinchouius, p.</hi> 342. <hi>Sometimes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he doth ſooner helpe by his grace greater ſinners then leſſer: for who ſhall preſcribe a meaſure to God, that he ſhould not ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the law, made by himſelfe, giue according to his liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, greater gifts to the worſe men?</hi> This confeſſion I think is cleare enough: for if theſe things be true, it cannot be denied, but that God by his antecedent will may moſt loue the worſt men, ſeeing that by that antecedent wil, he doth giue more good things to them, &amp; doth beſtow on them that grace which he doth deny to others that are leſſe euill. For it cannot be ſaid, that this grace is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the worſt men, by that will which doth follow mans will: ſeeing that no will of man that is good, but euen a moſt wicked diſpoſition doth goe before the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of grace. But perhaps God doth this ſeldome, &amp; as <hi>Greuinchoutus</hi> ſaith, beſides the law that he hath made.

For ſo the glory and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God doth more clearely ſhine forth, by which he doth breake the moſt hard things, and doth ruſh through all obſtacles; and where ſeeming and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited wiſdome, or moſt deſperate manners, did ſeeme

Yet a liberty from conſtraint, and phyſicall neceſſity hath remained to the will: for if the will could be compelled, it were not <hi>voluntas,</hi> a will, but <hi>noluntas,</hi> a nill &amp; vnwillingnes. Or if by an externall principle, by a naturall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable law, it ſhould be neceſſarily determined to one thing; it were not a will, but either a violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, or a naturall inclination and propenſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of knowledge and iudgement, ſuch as is the inclination of all heauy things to the center of the world. For ſeeing there are three kindes of liberty; the firſt is from conſtraint, and phyſicall or naturall neceſſitie; the ſecond from ſinne; the third from miſery: Man, while he is in this preſent life, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be fully free from ſinne and miſery; but to theſe two liberties he ſhall come in the life to come: The liberty from conſtraint and phyſicall neceſſity is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall to the will, and inſeperable from it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſeate of this liberty, is in the will; becauſe it hath gotten the dominion, concerning voluntary actions: For although the will in particular actions
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:11390:151"/>doth follow the perſwaſion of the vnderſtanding, yet the vnderſtanding doth not iudge nor deliberate, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be commanded by the will; for the dominion whereof man doth apply himſelfe to deliberation and ſearching out of the truth: After the ſame manner that a blinde Maſter doth in euery thing obey his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, leading him and perſwading him; which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, notwithſtanding, doth it that he may obey his Maſter, who will haue himſelfe led, and admoniſhed by him.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the Scripture ſaith, that man is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of ſinne, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.17. and ſould vnder ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. And dead in ſinne, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1.5. and <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.13. it is worth the labour, to know how farre this liberty of mans will doth extend it ſelfe, as well vnder the eſtate of ſinne, and before regeneration, as vnder the eſtate of grace and regeneration.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The will is the reaſonable appetite, which of his owne nature, is alwaies carried to good, whether it be good truely, or in appearance: for it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that one ſhould deſire euill, as it is euill, and not vnder the reſpect of good.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The liberty of the will, whereby it may will ſomething, or not will it, is called the liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; but the liberty whereby it may will ſome. thing, or the contrary of it, is called the liberty of contrariety.</p>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:11390:152"/>good doth put on the forme of good.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. We all doe neceſſarily will the laſt &amp; chiefe end, <hi>to wit,</hi> felicity; neither doth the deſiring of the laſt end fall into deliberation: For no man can procure from himſelfe, that he ſhould will himſelfe to be miſerable: But yet we will that end freely, becauſe we doe will it without conſtraint, and with knowledge and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whence it commeth to paſſe that this deſiring is not onely <hi>ſpontaneus,</hi> but alſo voluntary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Furthermore, there are many kindes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions: For ſome are meerely naturall, <hi>as the contrary motion of the</hi> Arteries, and beating of the pulſe, the digeſtion of nouriſhment, &amp;c. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not in our power, nor at mans pleaſure, the will is neyther occupied about them, nor doe they fall within the compaſſe of Election or delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Some actions are partly naturall, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voluntarie, as to eate, to walke, &amp;c. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be naturall, yet they are gouerned by the will. In theſe actions the will is free, vnleſſe when ſome externall force compels, or ſome vnauoidable neceſſity doth vrge, men being vnwilling.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. There are alſo ſome actions that are ciuill, as to ſell, to buy, to bargaine, to play, to build, to paint: In theſe things the will of man is free, and doth freely incline it ſelfe to one or other: For hee that doth theſe things at the command of another, yet is willing to obey him that commandeth, and therefore is driuen to doe it, not onely by anothers will, but alſo by his owne. Of this liberty the Apoſtle
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:11390:153"/>ſpeaketh, <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.37. <hi>He that ſtandeth stedfaſt in his heart, hauing no neceſsity, but hath power ouer his owne will, &amp; hath ſo decreed in his heart, that he will keep his virgin, doth well:</hi> For in this place the Apoſtle vnderſtandeth, by that which is done well, not that which is done agreeable to Gods law, but that which is done prudently, and fitly, to the preſent time and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Alſo in actions that are ciuilly honeſt, the will of man is moued by its owne pleaſure, as when a heathen man helpes vp him that is fallen, or ſheweth the way to him that is out of it.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The like liberty is in the obſeruation of Eccleſiaſticall pollicy, and in thoſe workes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the law of God, which doe belong to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward operation; for the moſt wicked men, doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme holy rites and religious ceremonies, doe beſtow almes, doe heare and reade the word of God.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. But eſpecially in euill actions man is free. For hee is not onely of his owne accord carried to ſinne, but alſo of two or more euills, moſt freely hee doth chooſe eyther, and doth voluntarily apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to that, to which his minde leads him. Wherefore ſeeing man, that is naturally euill, is gouerned by his owne euill will, and that one is for that cauſe ſaid to be free, becauſe he doth what he liſteth, it is manifeſt, that man is therefore the ſeruant of ſinne, becauſe he is in ſubiection to his owne will, and becauſe he doth ſinne voluntarily and freely, and that man is therefore a ſeruant becauſe he is free.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. They that ſay that an vnregenerate man by this ſeruitude &amp; naturall deprauation doth neceſſarily
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:11390:153"/>ſin, ought not to be reprehended; for an vnregenerate man muſt needes ſin: Thus the diuels doe neceſſarily ſinne, but yet freely; for they ſinne being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, nor determined and appointed <hi>to any one thing onely,</hi> by any outward cauſe forcing them: But they are led by their owne motion, by their ingrafted wickedneſſe, and with their knowledge; after the ſame manner that the Saints that are glorified, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and immutably good, but yet voluntarily and freely: For it is not credible, that the Saints haue loſt their liberty by their glorification.

               <p n="17">XVII. There are moreouer, habits and actions, <hi>that is,</hi> vertues and workes, which doe helpe forward to ſaluation, and which are proper to the faithfull. Such as are the true knowledge and feruent loue of God, ſaith and repentance, and holy actions flowing from theſe vertues. In and about theſe things, the will of a man that is vnregenerate, and ſtanding in his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:11390:154"/>pure and meere naturals is not free; here is no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of man, no inclination, no diſpoſition: Surely it had beene a very hard thing to finde in <hi>Paul,</hi> raging againſt the Church, and in the theefe, crucified for his robberies, whom Chriſt conuerted in the very agony of his death, any diſpoſitions or preparations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. I doe not deny, but that there are memorized many things of heathen men, which were done honeſtly, and profitably for ciuill ſociety, for concord, and for the defence of their countrie: But ſeeing, <hi>Without faith we cannot pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11.6. And ſeeing that that action alone is acceptable to God, which is done with Faith (for, <hi>Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is done without faith is ſinne, Rom.</hi> 14.23.) and which is referred to the glory of God, as the Apoſtle commandeth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. It is plaine, that thoſe honeſt deedes of the heathen were not without fault, and that they could not come to ſaluation by ſuch ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill vertues, nor that any one could by them be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to faith or true repentance. The right outward duties of ciuill vertues, are of one ſort, the duties of faith and Chriſtian piety are of another ſort. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my iudgement, the heathen iudge, who in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſentence, and in diuiding poſſeſſions doth iudge equally and well, is no more iuſt before the tribunall of God, then the theeues who equally and iuſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the pray among themſelues: For whoſoeuer doth want faith in Chriſt, is not the Sonne of God, and therefore cannot be an heire and iuſt poſſeſſor of worldly goods, although he excell in ciuill vertues. For a kinde of doubtfull light, and ſome ſeedes of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:11390:154"/>equity are left in man for ciuill ſociety: And they to whom the light of the Goſpell doth ſhine, if they giue themſelues ouer to vices ſhould be confounded with ſhame, being vrged by theſe examples.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. But after God hath enlightned the minde of any one with his light, and hath touched his heart with repentance, and hath wrought in him faith in Chriſt, then the will of man beginneth to moue it ſelfe willingly and freely to holy actions, to which it is not forced by phiſicall or naturall neceſſity, but it is ſo turned by a milde and effectuall, eyther perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or influence, that the will may freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly follow God calling: For otherwiſe that were not a good worke, whereunto one ſhould be drawne by conſtraint, or ſhould be compelled by a naturall neceſſity. He that doth good vnwillingly, doth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly: Such a man is ſufficiently rewarded, if God pardon his obedience; for although God hate euill, yet he will not therefore compell to good: Becauſe a good worke is not good, but when it is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. And although man is freely moued to the workes of piety, yet the whole praiſe of the good worke is due to God, who worketh <hi>in vs to will, and to doe, of his good pleaſure, Phil</hi> 2. So, although the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in the mothers wombe doth moue it ſelfe, and doth helpe forward his owne natiuity, yet it hath that power of mouing from God: Therefore, euen as if any one doth aſcribe the whole praiſe of the forming of the infant, the generation and birth of it to God alone, he doth not thereby hinder the birth of the infant, or diminiſh the vigour of it: So he that doth
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:11390:155"/>aſcribe to God the whole praiſe of our regeneration and holy actions, doth not thereby hinder the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of good workes, nor weaken the will of man, or binde it with the bonds of naturall neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. Here therefore a diſtinction is to be vſed: For if it be ſpoken of the beginning of conuerſion, and of the firſt entrance of regeneration and faith, <hi>that is,</hi> of the procuring or forming of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in our ſoules, wee contend that free-will doth nothing here, and that our ſoules in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings are, not onely meerely paſſiue, but alſo that <hi>they doe</hi> with their greateſt endeauour reſiſt the worke of God, forming in vs the rudiments and draughts of the new man, ſo that man in this caſe is not free, vnleſſe it be to reſiſt God. But after rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration begunne, and after God hath giuen to man a heart of fleſh for his heart of ſtone, then man doth freely moue himſelfe to thoſe workes which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. And as there are ſecret, but yet certaine increaſings of regeneration, ſo this liberty doth increaſe by little and little, fainting euery day with the reſiſtance of our luſts. By this meanes mans will doth cooperate and worke together with God, yet ſo, that whatſoeuer good is done, is due to God alone: No otherwiſe, then as when a ſcriuener doth guide the ſhaking hand of the childe, and doth at the firſt frame it to make letters; the childe indeede doth indeauour to forme the letters, and doth ſtriue with all his power, yet the right forming of the letters is not to be aſcribed to the childe, but to the ſcriue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: This example ſeemeth to me to be moſt fit, becauſe it teacheth that God doth not onely worke
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:11390:155"/>with our will (as the <hi>Semipelagian</hi> Synergiſts, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of our cooperation with God, of this our age, would haue it) but alſo that God doth worke by our wills, and doth bend them by an effectuall motion, which motion after what manner, and how farre man may reſiſt, ſhall hereafter be taught.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Wee therefore ſay that the act of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and repenting, is ſo farre the act of man, in as much as man himſelfe beleeueth and repenteth, and not God; and in as much as no man beleeueth and repenteth, but he doth it willingly. But we ſay, that the grace of God alone, doth create and giue the firſt being to faith in vs, and that it is the gift of God, and by the power of the regenerating ſpirit, that wee doe willingly and freely beleeue and repent. For the queſtion is not who beleeueth, whether man or God; but what doth bring forth faith in man, and whether it be in the power of free-will, helped with grace, to beleeue or not to beleeue, and to vſe grace or not to vſe it.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. From this doctrine (the foundations and proofes whereof ſhall be brought out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture in the next chapter) <hi>Arminius,</hi> and his Sectaries doe infinitely and exceedingly differ: For, they are of opinion, that an vnregenerate man hath power of beleeuing and repenting. The <hi>Arminian</hi> conferrers at the Hage, <hi>Page</hi> 272. doe affirme, that conuerſion doth goe before faith, and that man doth helpe ſomewhat to his owne conuerſion before hee hath faith. And turning ouer the writings of theſe Sectaries, I finde that they determine, that by the corruption of nature, mans vnderſtanding is darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:11390:156"/>and his affections are depraued; but I no where finde in their writings, that his will is of its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And they will not haue the viuification and reuiuing of the will in our regeneration, to conſiſt in this, that of being naturally euill, it is made good by the infuſion of ſome vertue, but that by the illumination of the vnderſtanding, the amend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ment of the affections <hi>the will is made able to put forth that faculty of willing or nil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which is ingrafied in it.</hi> This the <hi>Arminians</hi> of the conferrence at the Hage teach, <hi>Page</hi> 25. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſame men, a little after, ſay theſe words: <hi>In our ſpirituall death, the ſpirituall gifts are not properly ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the will of man, becauſe they were neuer engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it.</hi> Surely thoſe men are of opinion, that the will of <hi>Adam,</hi> before his fall, was not furniſhed with righteouſneſſe and holineſſe: For it cannot be denyed but that theſe vertues are ſpirituall gifts; which certainely is a prodigious and monſtrous diuinity.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. The ſame men doe affirme, that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grace is giuen to all men, euen to vnregenerate and heathen men, to whom the name of Chriſt hath not come, whereby they may obtaine faith, if they will: And that an vnregenerate man is not altogether

               <p n="25">XXV. Notable are the words of <hi>Arminius, pa.</hi> 244. againſt <hi>Perkins. Doeſt thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deny that free-will is</hi> flexible <hi>and pliant to either part? I adde further, and that alſo without grace: for it is flexible of its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as it is addicted to euill in the ſtate of ſinne, ſo it is capable of good, which capableneſſe, grace doth not giue it, for it is in it by nature.</hi> Hee therefore doth differ from himſelfe, when hee addes, <hi>that free will is not bowed to good, without the grace of God.</hi> For how doe theſe things ſtand together? that free-will is flexible to good, without grace; and yet it is not bowed to good without grace? In vaine is that power which is neuer brought into act: For whence doth hee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that that thing may be done, which he himſelfe knoweth neuer was done, nor neuer ſhall be. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pertaineth that which he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 257. <hi>To be able to beleeue is in nature, to beleeue is of grace:</hi> therefore to be able to beleeue is not of grace. There is indeede naturally in man a poſſibility of hauing or receiuing faith; but it is not in him by nature to be able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue; for theſe things doe very much differ. The firſt notes the ſuſceptability and poſſibility of receiuing faith: the other ſigniſieth the actiue power and faculty
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:11390:157"/>of beleeuing, which ſurely is not in man by nature, but is onely from grace.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 271. layeth this to our charge, as a very great errour, that we ſay that the regenerate man cannot doe any <hi>good,</hi> vnleſſe hee be moued by grace. Truely a great crime, and that which is common to vs with the Apoſtle, who doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, <hi>that we are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any thing, as of our ſelues, but all our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. The ſame <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 447. doth make the vſe of grace ſubiect to mans will: <hi>It is determined,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the vſe of grace is ſubiect to mans will, that man may vſe it, or not vſe it, according to his naturall liberty:</hi> And a little after he doth confeſſe, <hi>that the effect of the mercy of God, was made by</hi> Arminius <hi>to be in the power of man, but ſuch a man as is already ſtrengthened with grace.</hi> To vſe which grace, or not to vſe it; to beleeue, or not to beleeue, he thinkes is in the power of mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.

Here the words of <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 381. <hi>The good vſing of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, is principally from grace, but yet ſo, that man himſelfe doth vſe well his owne free-will: and the liberty of vſing, or not vſing grace is left to him.</hi> For theſe ſectaries are of opinion, that the power of beleeuing is vnreſiſtably giuen to all, and that the act of beleeuing is ſo helped by grace, that it is left to mans free-will to beleeue in act, or not to beleeue, &amp; to vſe grace either well or ill.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. And they deny that faith is from grace alone, but that it is partly from grace, and partly from free-will. <hi>Greuinchouius, pag.</hi> 208. and 210. <hi>It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that free-will and grace are together cauſes in part:</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 211. <hi>We ioyne grace and free-will together, as cauſes in part:</hi> He muſt ſo ſpeake, who ſaith that Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is for faith fore-ſeen: For God would be very vnfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to fore-ſee that which he alone is to do; for this is not to fore-ſee, but to decree: Hitherto alſo pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that conditional decree of ſauing men, if they ſhal beleeue; for by this it is placed in the power of man to beleeue: For this were a fooliſh decree; <hi>I will ſaue him, if I ſhall giue him faith.

It appeareth (if we may credit <hi>Arminius</hi>) that to be made the ſonnes of God, is a thing proper to free-will, and although it cannot be done without the helpe of grace, yet the effect doth depend on mans will: So that God is willingly indebted to man; for hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to free-will that he hath ſonnes.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. This is the malicious and blacke iuyce of the fiſh Loligo; and this is their moſt peſtilent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: of which, what is to be iudged it is eaſie to coniecture by thoſe ſpeeches which euery where meet vs in the bookes of theſe ſectaries.

For that I was able, it was of God ſhewing mercy, but that I was willing, when I might haue beene vnwilling, it was my owne power.</hi> It is a venter, but this little worme will ſwell ſo big, that he will breake. O it is the part of a magnanimious &amp; great minded man, to be vnwilling
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:11390:159"/>to owe too much to God, and not to be ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with his benefits. Thoſe things which the ſame author ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 279. ſauour of no leſſe pride: <hi>You will ſay that in this manner of working, God doth after a certaine manner, depend on the will of man: I grant it, as concerning the act of free determination.</hi> Indeede this one thing was wanting, to the very height of pride, that God ſhould be ſaid to depend on man.</p>
               <p n="29">XXIX. There meete vs in the writings of theſe innouators, ſome places, in which they ſay, that man in his corrupted ſtate was altogether dead, and that of himſelfe, he can neither thinke, nor will, nor doe, any thing that is good. But theſe things are ſaid but for a colour, and that they might deceiue the vnwary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: For they ſay, that a man is able to doe no good without grace; but by this grace, they vnderſtand vniuerſall grace, which is common to all men, and ſufficient grace, which is giuen, euen to them to whom Chriſt was made knowne, and which doth extend it ſelfe as farre as nature: They ſay indeede, that grace is the cauſe of beleeuing, but they neuer adde, that it is the cauſe alone. The <hi>Arminian</hi> conferrers at the <hi>Hage,</hi> in the third and fourth Articles, doe ſo ſpeake as if they were of the ſame opinion with vs: For there they profeſſe, <hi>that man hath not ſaning faith from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and that the grace of God is the beginning, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and the finiſhing of all good, and that all good actions are to be aſcribed to the grace of God in Chriſt:</hi> But the ſubtle men, when they ſay that a man hath not faith from himſelfe, they vnderſtand, that he hath it not from himſelfe alone: And when they ſay, that euery good worke is to be aſcribed to grace, they are
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:11390:159"/>very wary, leaſt they ſhould ſay <hi>to grace alone.</hi> Then alſo in the word <hi>grace,</hi> they lay a ſnare, and being the Apes of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> they faigne a certaine grace, which is common to all, which doth extend it ſelfe as farre as nature: Alſo they diſtinguiſh grace from the vſe of grace; for indeede, they will haue grace to be from God, but the vſe of grace to be in the power of mans free-will: With the like craft, they ſay, that the power of beleeuing is from grace: for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently draw backe what they haue reached forth, while they ſay, that to beleeue it ſelfe, is of mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; and that grace is giuen to man to beleeue, if he will. But whenſoeuer they will haue a kinde of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace to come to that generall grace, they make the vſe of this ſpeciall grace to depend on free-will; and they roundly, and without any circumſtances affirme, that the efficiency, and working power of grace, doth depend vpon it.</p>
               <p>We ſhall alſo ſee, that by that vniuerſall and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grace, common to all men, is vnderſtood naturall gifts, &amp; notions that are naturally engrafted, and that they cloath nature with the goodly name of grace; (which thing alſo <hi>Pelagius</hi> did:) Which thing, when they doe with their greateſt cunning, yet their diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling is neuer ſo wary, but that their <hi>Pelagian eares</hi> and errour doe appeare: and although they doe imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the ſpeech of truth, yet their vizard doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fall from them vnawares; and their vlcers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed, doe preſently caſt forth ſtinking cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>

And that which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.17. <hi>The ſpirit of truth, whom the world cannot receiue, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him.</hi> Chriſt in theſe words doth plainely acknowledge that there is no free will of man, no power to receiue the ſpirit of truth, but a naturall auerſion and diſability.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Wherefore the Scripture doth call the change of man, by the ſpirit of regeneration, ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther birth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. ſometimes the creation of the new man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. It calleth it, another reſurrection from the dead, <hi>Reucl.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.32. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.25. Not that creation and reſurrection is in all things like to regeneration and the change of the ſoule; but only
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:11390:161"/>in this thing of which it is here ſpoken, <hi>to wit,</hi> as the Carkaſſe cannot diſpoſe nor prepare it ſelfe to the reſurrection, and a thing that is not created, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not further any thing to the creation of it: So man in the ſtate of ſinne, and before his regeneration, hath nothing whereby he may diſpoſe himſelfe, or further his regeneration and ſpirituall new birth.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Arminian</hi> conferrers at the Hage, <hi>Page</hi> 279. doe roundly confeſſe, that by our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all death, the liberty of doing well or ill, is ſeparated from the ſoule. I demand therefore whether an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man, furniſhed with that ſufficient and vniuerſall grace, which is giuen euen to Reprobates, hath free-will of doing well or ill in thoſe things which belong to ſaluation? If he haue not, why doe the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> contend he hath? If hee hath it is plaine by their owne confeſſion, that he is not dead in ſinne.</p>
               <p>But there is a ſpeciall force in the word <hi>borne:</hi> For if there were any ſeeds and reliques of ſpirituall life in an vnregenerate man, as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> is of opinion, there were no neede to be borne againe, <hi>and that the new man</hi> ſhould be formed, but God were to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, that he would againe raiſe vp thoſe ſparkes and reliques of ſpirituall life, and would vouchſafe to kindle and increaſe it, as it were, by adding fuell to it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Adde to theſe, thoſe places which teach vs, that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. That all men haue not faith, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. becauſe it is the gift of God, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. Seeing therefore what ſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.25. it is plain that in things which belong to ſaluation and to the worſhip of God, hee doth nothing but
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:11390:161"/>ſinne that wants faith, ſuch as are all the heathen and vnregenerate men. In which place to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> it is to be noted, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the vſe of meates, which he will haue vs to eate with faith, <hi>that is,</hi> with a certaine knowledge that the vſe of meates is allowed by God, and is agreeable to his word. Seeing therefore that, euen in things which are of their owne nature indifferent wee ſinne, when we vſe them without ſuch a faith, how much more are we to thinke that the heathens ſinne in euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that pertaineth to ſaluation and the worſhip of God, becauſe they are altogether deſtitute of this faith?</p>
               <p>Hitherto pertaine thoſe places which teach vs that God is the author of euery vertue, and euery good worke that is done by vs. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelues to thinke any thing, as of our ſelues; but our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is of God,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. And Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can doe nothing.</hi> And in the ſame place, we are compared to branches cut off and appointed to the fire, vnleſſe wee haue beene engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Chriſt, by whom wee liue and beare fruit. The Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. doth teach, that ſaluation and faith is not of our ſelues, but of the gift of God: <hi>For by grace ye are ſaued through faith, and that not of your ſelues, it is the gift of God.</hi> How farre is this from <hi>Arminius,</hi> who will haue the totall cauſe of faith, not to be grace alone, but grace and free-will. And leaſt any of <hi>Arminius</hi> followers ſhould ſeeke a refuge, and ſhould ſay that the power of beleeuing is giuen to all vnreſiſtably, but that the act of beleeuing is ſo helped by grace, that it is alſo from free-wil, the Apoſtle doth
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:11390:162"/>fitly preuent ſuch a weake ſubtilty, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. where he ſaith, <hi>It is giuen to you, in the behalfe of Chriſt, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beleeue on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> You ſee that not onely the power of beleeuing is giuen vs; but alſo the act it ſelfe, to beleeue. Agreeable to this is that, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>No man can come to me vnleſſe my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw him:</hi> Where to come, is to beleeue in act, and not to haue the power and faculty of beleeuing which is brought into act by free-will. No leſſe direct is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is God which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in you both to will, and to doe, of his good pleaſure.</hi> Now to will, is to will in act, and not to haue the power of willing. God himſelfe, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 36.27. ſaith, <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and will cauſe you to walke in my statutes.</hi> Therefore hee doth not onely giue the power of walking in his ſtatutes, but alſo doth cauſe that we really walke, and doth worke in vs the very act. After <hi>what manner and how farre</hi> the elect may reſiſt the efficacy of the ſpirit ſhall hereafter be ſeene. It is ſufficient to the preſent queſtion, if we winne this of them, that God doth not onely giue the power whereby we may beleeue, but alſo that hee doth giue and worke in vs the act of beleeuing, to beleeue it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>We meete ſometimes with places where the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> ſay that not onely the power of beleeuing, but that alſo the act of beleeuing, to beleeue it ſelfe, is giuen by God. But they will haue this act ſo to be giuen by God, in as much as he giueth knowledge to the minde, and doth raiſe vp the fainting affections which doe put forward the will to beleeue, and that this is done by a morall perſwaſion, and after the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:11390:162"/>ſame manner that wee are moued by obiects: But this is not to giue faith and the act of beleeuing. For ſurely hee that doth perſwade, that doth propound obiects, and doth inuite the appetite to runne, doth not giue the act of running, to runne it ſelfe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe deny that faith it ſelfe is infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or imprinted on the heart by God, but that the will is inuited to beleeue onely by a morall perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by a courteous allurement.</p>
               <p>With a like fraud (that they might ſeeme to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſome great thing to God) they ſay that God doth giue the power of beleeuing, and that vnreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: But when they come to explane the manner whereby theſe powers are ſupplied, it is manifeſt that they deny that the power of beleeuing is giuen to man by God: For they thinke that God doth giue theſe powers no otherwiſe then by enlightning the vnderſtanding with knowledge, and by ſtirring vp the appetites, which certainely is not to giue the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of beleeuing: For hee which in the darke doth with a torch giue light to the wandring traueller, and doth ſtirre him vp to goe, doth not thereby giue him the power of going.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And leaſt any man ſhould in any part arrogate to himſelf the prayſe, eyther of that knowledge which he hath obtained, or of that loue wherewith he feeles himſelfe to be affected, Chriſt doth beate downe all pride, in ſpeaking thus to <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Bleſſed art thou</hi> Symon Bar-Iona, <hi>for fleſh and blood hath not reuealed this vnto thee, but my father which is in heauen.</hi> And, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.25. he doth giue thanks to his father, that hee hath hidden theſe things from the wiſe
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:11390:163"/>and men of vnderſtanding, and hath reuealed them to babes.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. And eſpecially when it is ſpoken of the loue of God, and of obedience to his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Scripture will haue vs to acknowledge that whatſoeuer is done well by vs, is receiued from God: <hi>We loue God becauſe he hath loued vs firſt, Iohn.</hi> 4.19. For this is one of the effects of the loue of God towards vs, that it doth put into our hearts a loue of him: God himſelfe thus ſpeaketh, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi> And Chapter 32. <hi>I will put my feare into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> bringeth this reaſon, as the cauſe why the Iſraelites did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent at the law of God, ratified with ſo many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and confirmed with ſo many miracles, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>The Lord hath not giuen you a heart to perceiue, nor eyes to ſee.</hi> Let <hi>Arminius</hi> tell mee whether theſe men had ſufficient power to beleeue, or ſufficient grace, which with the helpe of free-will, they might haue rightly vſed if they would. Fie on this forgerie. And yet was not God the cauſe of the impenitency and blindneſſe of that people: For hee that will not heale him that is blinde, is not the cauſe of his blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: God did not put this wickedneſſe in man, but he knoweth who they are on whom hee will haue mercy, and he hath reaſon for his actions, to enquire into which were not onely raſh, but alſo dangerous.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Saint <hi>Paul, Galath.</hi> 3.26. ſaith, <hi>That wee are the ſonnes of God, by faith in Chriſt.</hi> If therefore it be in the power of mans free-will, being helped with grace to beleeue, or not to beleeue, to vſe that grace
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:11390:163"/>or not to vſe it, it muſt needes alſo be in the power of free-will, helped with grace, to effect, that we may be the ſonnes of God, or may not: Which is contrary not onely to piety, but alſo to common ſence; for who euer effected that he was the ſonne of his father? or who is beholding to himſelfe for any part of his generation?</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of him that ſheweth mercy.</hi> By him that willeth and him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, hee vnderſtandeth him that worketh, for the conſideration of workes is excluded from the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or (as <hi>Arminius</hi> had rather) from the iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, that this benefit might be acknowledged to be receiued from the mercy of God alone. <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> offendeth againſt this rule: For by his doctrine, the conuerſion of a man by faith, and therefore both his righteouſneſſe and ſaluation, is of him that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and of him that runneth, &amp; of him that worketh, <hi>that is,</hi> of him who by the helpe of his free-will, doth vſe vniuerſall grace well, and who doth therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, becauſe to the helpe of grace, hee hath brought the power of free-will, by which hee hath obtained Faith. For (as I haue ſaid) the <hi>Arminians</hi> make the cauſe of faith, to be theſe two ioyned together, <hi>to wit,</hi> grace and free-will; to vſe which free-will to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſaith, and to the conuerting of himſelfe, is certainely to will and to runne: The Apoſtle ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to haue ſaid, <hi>It is of man that willeth and runneth, and of God which ſheweth mercy,</hi> that free-will might be ioyned with the mercy of God. And if (as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith fitly, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Simplic. Quaeſt.</hi> 2. It
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:11390:164"/>may be ſaid, <hi>That it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,</hi> becauſe conuerſion and ſaluation, is not by the free-will of man alone; why may it not alſo be ſaid, that it is not of God that ſheweth mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe conuerſion is not made by the grace of God alone, but alſo by free-will? <hi>It skilleth</hi> nothing that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> vſed this argument againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who denied that we were preuented by grace, for it hath the ſame force againſt the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> who ioyne free-will to grace: Seeing that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>That it is not alone of him that willeth,</hi> but doth altogether exclude free-will.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Finally, this argument hath ſo tormented <hi>Arnoldus, Page</hi> 445. that he would ſeeme to yeeld to our part; for he ſaith, <hi>It is not placed in our will, that we ſhould obey the calling of God, but this thing it ſelfe is alſo from the mercy of God.</hi> But the ſcoffing and crafty man, is very wary leaſt hee ſhould ſay ſomewhat that ſhould hurt his owne cauſe: For when he ſaith that it is not placed in our will, he vnderſtandeth <hi>alone:</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would not ſay, that this is wholy placed in the mercy of God alone, but tenderly and with a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpeech he ſaith, <hi>that it is placed in the mercy of God:</hi> He might, yea he ought to ſay ſo much of free-will, that he might agree to himſelfe; for he thinketh that it is not placed in the grace of God alone, nor in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will alone.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That man cannot be conuerted vnleſſe God conuert him, and that the whole praiſe of our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is due to God, <hi>Ieremy</hi> teacheth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Conuert me, and I ſhall be conuerted;</hi> which is alſo repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the laſt Chapter of the <hi>Lamentations.</hi> I am
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:11390:164"/>aſhamed of the weake interpretation of the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> conferrers at the <hi>Hage,</hi> who <hi>pag.</hi> 266. by <hi>conuerted,</hi> would haue <hi>corrected</hi> to be vnderſtood: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo cleare and direct in the holy Scripture, which may not be corrupted with a fooliſh and raſh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: who hauing but little ſkill in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> is ignorant that the Verbe <hi>ſhub,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>to be turned,</hi> and not to puniſh; and therefore in the contugation <hi>Hiphil,</hi> it is <hi>to cauſe that one be conuerted,</hi> and not that he be puniſhed. Or who doth not ſee how ridiculous a thing it were, if men bruiſed with afflictions, ſhould pray that they might be ſtill afflicted? As if any one that were grieuouſly whipped, ſhould deſire more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer that he might be buffeted? But <hi>Ieremy</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelfe, and doth teach what it is to be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for he addeth, <hi>being conuerted, I will repent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my ſelfe:</hi> this indeede is to be conuerted. Seeing therefore that men, who are already conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſay; <hi>Conuert me, and I ſhall be conuerted, Ier.</hi> 31. <hi>Draw me, and I will runne, Cant.</hi> 1. And doe aſcribe the progreſſe and the proceeding of their conuerſion to God alone: how much more is the beginning of our conuerſion to be attributed to God alone? For if they that are already willing, doe confeſſe that they owe to God whatſoeuer good they doe, and that without his grace, they cannot moue a foote fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; how much more is it to be determined, that of being vnwilling, wee cannot be made willing, of dead, aliue, vnleſſe God draw vs, and make vs aliue?</p>
               <p n="12">XII. And to ouerthrow thoſe preparations, by which the ſectaries thinke, that an vnregenerate man
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:11390:165"/>well vſing vniuerſall grace and naturall light, doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and prepare himſelfe to regeneration; that which God ſaith, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. doth greatly preuaile; <hi>I will giue you a new heart, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of you, and I will giue you an heart of fleſh; I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes.</hi> For ſeeing that God himſelfe witneſſeth, that in thoſe things which belong to the worſhip of God and to ſaluation, man hath naturally a ſtony heart, which hath neede to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and another to be giuen by God, in which God ſhould imprint the character of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: it manifeſtly appeareth, that an vnregenerate man cannot prepare himſelfe to his regeneration: For that which muſt be taken away, and muſt be changed for another, that we may be regenerated; certainely, that doth not further regeneration, nor doth prepare vs to it, for otherwiſe we ſhould be helped by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments themſelues.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 461. doth anſwere, that this phraſe of a ſtony and fleſhly heart is figuratiue and Symbolicall diuinitie cannot proue any thing. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that figuratiue ſpeeches haue the force of thoſe that are properly ſpoken, when they are expounded by the Scripture it ſelfe; &amp; when it is euident to what end, and in what ſence they are vſed: Now in the ſame place of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> there are many words that are plaine, and not figuratiue, which doe make cleare this figure; for in the ſame place, God doth promiſe that hee will giue them a new ſpirit, by which he would cauſe that they ſhould walke in his waies.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Wherefore <hi>Arnoldus</hi> with a ſuperfluous
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:11390:165"/>diligence, and nothing to the purpoſe, doth heape to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the differences betweene the heart and a ſtone. A ſtone hath not life, the heart hath; a ſtone cannot be ſoftned without the taking away of the ſubſtantiall forme, the hart may; the ſtone ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reſiſt his own ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the heart may: All beſides the matter, for in that one thing of which it is ſpoken here, the compariſon is moſt apt: For euen as the ſtone cannot ſoften it ſelfe, but it is ſoftned onely by the power of an outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: ſo the vnregenerate heart cannot conuert it ſelfe, or diſpoſe it ſelfe to regeneration, but it is done one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the efficacy of the ſpirit of God: He that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ſhall ſeeke compariſons, ſhall finde infinite differences; as that a ſtone may be engrauen, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, may be taken out of the quarries, and be laid on the building, &amp;c. but the heart cannot.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doe vexe theſe <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mipelagians,</hi> when he ſaith, that man is dead in ſinne, and he ſpeaketh of the vnregenerate man: The point of which dart, that they might auoide and make fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, they doe laboriouſly heape together differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betweene a dead corps, and an vnregenerate man; which doe tend thither, that they might proue that an vnregenerate man, is not altogether dead in ſinne, and as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> ſaith, <hi>hath ſome reliques of the ſpirituall life:</hi> To which naturall reliques and remainds of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall and ſufficient grace, he added, which they ſay is giuen to all men, euen vnregenerates and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, by which there is no man, but may fulfill the law and obtaine faith; certainely, there will be found in an vnregenerate man, very much life, and there will be none or very little conueniency or ſimilitude, with
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:11390:166"/>him that is dead. It is well therefore, that theſe ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doe thither apply all their force, that they might ſhew that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſpeake ſo properly as he ſhould. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> layeth downe theſe differences, <hi>pag</hi> 466. and 468. In reſurrection the ſoule is inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in regeneration it is onely changed: in reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there doth no diſpoſitions and preparations goe before, but regeneration is made after ſome fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſitions: Alſo our reſurrection is done in an inſtant, but our regeneration by degrees. Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is done neceſſarily, but regeneration is wrought, our free will remaining. In the dead carkaſſe, there are no reliques of life, but in an vnregenerate man, there are ſome reliques of ſpirituall life: God doth not ſpeake to a dead carkas, but he ſpeaketh to them that are dead in ſinne, and doth propound his word to them. He that is dead, cannot reſiſt his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the vnregenerate man may. I doe not deny, but that this ſimilitude doth not ſquare in all things: there is no doubt, but that <hi>Arnoldus</hi> could haue found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other differences: as that the reſurrection of the body ſhall not be till the laſt day, that it ſhall be at the trumpe of the Angell. &amp;c. But it is ſufficient, that this ſimilitude doth well ſquare in that which is the principall of the matter, and in that, concerning which the controuerſie is betweene vs: <hi>to wit,</hi> in this, that as the dead corps is altogether vnapt to motion, and cannot diſpoſe nor prepare it ſelfe to the reſurrection; ſo the ſoule of a man that is vnregenerate and dead in ſinne, doth want in things ſpirituall and pertaining to ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uation all ſenſe and motion, and cannot prepare, nor diſpoſe it ſelfe to regeneration, vntill the ſpirit of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:11390:166"/>regeneration deſcend into the heart, ſtirre vp new motions, and doth worke the firſt beginnings of the new life: By <hi>ſenſe</hi> in ſpirituall things, I vnderſtand zeale, by <hi>motion,</hi> good workes. And ſurely, theſe things ſeeme to me to be repugnant; <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>z.</hi> to be dead in ſinne, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, and to haue reliques and remainds of ſpirituall life, as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> ſaith. For death in ſpirituall things, doth altogether exclude ſpirituall life: I willingly acknowledge, that there are ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of truth, and ſpurkes of light in an vnregenerate man, &amp; ſome obſcure prints of the Image of God: But theſe reliques are not any part of ſpirituall life &amp; rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: the diuels themſelues haue much more light &amp; derſtanding, and yet they are altogether dead in ſins.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Neither are all thoſe differences true, which they doe bring! Firſt, we deny that God hath reſpect to the diſpoſitions of free-will, or that a man by free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will can prepure himſelfe to regeneration. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, doth by a mans calamities, and by his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out of them, and by the examples of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance that he taketh of the wicked, ſometimes make way to himſelfe for his regeneration: Alſo a man by a ſeruile feare, and dread of puniſhment, may profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be troubled: but I maintaine, that thoſe inward motions doe then begin to be laudable and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, when they are produced by the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not before: which when it is done, then I ſay, ſuch morions are a part of regeneration, and the firſt motions &amp; pulſes of the new man, &amp; although weake, yet ſure beginnings of the new life; &amp; not preparations of the free-will, which goe before regeneration, and by which God is moued to gine a greater meaſure of grace: But it is ſo farre, that God in beginning rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:11390:167"/>ſhould haue reſpect to fore-going diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that on the contrary, they are called, who are the greateſt ſtrangers from the kingdome of heauen, and who are ouer whelmed in greateſt darkneſſe. Let the Thiefe on the croſſe be an example, alſo the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the people of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> then which people, there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any more wicked in luſt, nor more effeminate in luxurie, of greater ignorance, or of more prodigious idolatry; whom yet ſo euill affected and diſpoled, God called by an effectuall calling, and hauing ſent his Apoſtles to them, gained them to Chriſt, that where ſinne did more abound, there grace alſo might more abound.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. And that regeneration is not alwayes wrought by degrees, the example of the conuerted Thiefe doth ſhew, who in the extreame inuaſion of ſpirituall agony, in one moment paſſed ouer an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable ſpace: and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="18">XVIII. That is no truer which they ſay, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is wrought, free-will remayning. For if free-will doth remaine in regeneration, it muſt needes be, that it goeth before regeneration: but in things that are ſpirituall, and which belong to ſaluation, there was no free-will before regeneration.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. It is of the ſame ſort, yea farre worſe, which they adde, that in an vnregenerate man, there are ſome reliques of the ſpirituall life: for ſo they aske that to be granted to them, which is the queſtion, and which we haue already proued to be falſe.</p>

               <p n="20">XX. Neither yet is that true which they ſay, that God doth not ſpeake to a dead corps; for Chriſt ſpake theſe words to <hi>Lazarus</hi> that was dead, <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus come forth, Luk.</hi> 11. And <hi>Eze.</hi> 37.4. God doth thus ſpeake to the bones that were long before withered: <hi>Oye dry bones, heare the word of the Lord.</hi> God calleth thoſe who are not, as if they were; but in that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, he cauſeth that they may be: The words of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.25. are direct to this purpoſe; <hi>The dead ſhall heare the voice of the ſonne of God, and they that heare ſhall liue.</hi> For as God with his light, doth ſo enlighten the blinde, that he alſo giueth them eyes; ſo by his word, he doth ſo ſpeake to the dead, that by that word he doth make them aliue.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI.

Paſſing well ſpoken; for they proue, that a man is not dead in ſinne, becauſe he can reſiſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; as if the remainds of our ſpirituall life were placed in the faculty of reſiſting God; when on the contrary, a man is therefore dead in ſinne, becauſe he can doe nothing but reſiſt. They doe therefore as much as if they ſhould ſay, that a man is not therefore dead in ſinne, becauſe he is dead in ſinne.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. And that which they ſay, that he which is dead, cannot reſiſt his reſurrection, but hee that is vnregenerated, may reſiſt his viuification; maketh for vs, and doth burden the cauſe of theſe innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: For thence it followeth that the death in ſinne, is farre the worſe death, and that he that is dead in
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:11390:168"/>ſinne is bound with ſtronger bonds, if he reſiſt his owne reſurrection, not onely in the beginnings of his regeneration, but alſo in the progreſſe of it: Yea, that very inclination to reſiſt God, is the chiefeſt part of that death and naturall corruption.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. In the meane while, the Reader ſhall obſerue, how artificiall a couert <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth vſe, while he ſaith, that he which is dead, cannot reſiſt his reſurrection, but he that is dead in ſinne, may reſiſt his viuification. The opinion of the <hi>Arminians</hi> is, that an vnregenerate man hath free-will, by which he may vſe ſufficient grace, or not vſe it, beleeue, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> therefore ought thus to haue framed his compariſon, ſaying, he that is dead, cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or further his owne reſurrection: but hee that is vnregenerate, may hinder or further his regeneration.

               <p n="24">XXIV. That is not to be paſſed ouer with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which the <hi>Arminians</hi> of the conference at the <hi>Hage, pag.</hi> 81. doe ſay. For there they make two kindes of vnregenerate men: ſome, who being left without any calling of God, doe walke in the vanity of their minde and thoughts. Theſe they confeſſe are dead in ſinne; but there are ſome, who are already called and ſtirred vp by the grace of God, whoſe vnderſtandings being enlightned, and their affections being enflamed, doe ſtirre vp the will to the apprehenſion of the truth. They deny that thoſe are dead in ſinne, becauſe their vnderſtandings and appetites are viuified, although
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:11390:168"/>the will is not yet drawne; here are many abſurdities. Firſt, becauſe they thinke that ſome are vnregenerate, who are already viuified and made aliue, when yet viuification and regeneration are the ſame thing. For if ones minde be quickned, it muſt needes alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated. Secondly; With the like error they place viuification there where there is not faith, ſeeing (as the Apoſtle witneſſeth) the iuſt doth liue by faith, and it is impious to acknowledge any viuification to be in an infidell and vnregenerate man. Thirdly; And they diſpute vntowardly, when they iudge it to be poſſible, the vnderſtanding being enlightned with the knowledge of the truth, and the appetite enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the loue of it, that the will ſhould be auerſe from this truth. And that a man may be quickned in his minde and affections, and yet his will remaines without life. For what ſhould turne away the will when they two doe inſtigate and ſtirre it vp, ſeeing that the will is moued by theſe two alone? Nor doth the will euer ſtand in doubt, but when reaſon ſtirreth it vp one way, and the appetites draw it another way, and the will is forced hither and thither, by the contrary ſuggeſtions of the minde and the appetites. Fourthly; Nor doe they agree to themſelues, when they ſay that there are ſome left without any calling of God, ſeeing that they maintaine with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that all men are called to ſaluation, not onely by an outward, but alſo by an inward calling, and that ſufficient grace is adminiſtred to all. Fiftly; Finally I demand whence they haue theſe two kindes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate perſons; If out of the Scripture, let them ſhew the place; If out of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:11390:169"/>wee doe not beleeue them.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> againſt <hi>Tilenus, Page</hi> 134. doth ſay that it may come to paſſe, that of two men furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with an equall helpe of grace, one may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, one not: But he ought alſo to ſhew whether it may come to paſſe, that of two that are equally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and furniſhed with the like helpe of grace (<hi>that is,</hi> hauing alike ſufficient and vniuerſall grace, and being alike called by the Goſpell) whether it can come to paſſe that one ſhould be conuerted, and another not. If it can come to paſſe; I demand whence is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? Was greater grace giuen to the one? No, he ſaid the grace was equall: Or is it becauſe one is better then another? No, the queſtion is, of them that are equally euill: Alſo if it were ſo, the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the one ſhould not be of grace alone, but of free-will: Neither is <hi>Arnoldus</hi> vnwilling to this, for he addes, <hi>Although God, who doth principally worke faith in man, doth ſeparate the faithfull man from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuer, yet becauſe he doth not worke faith and conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in man without the will of man, hee doth not ſeparate man without man.</hi> And a little after he addeth, <hi>That man doth ſeparate himſelfe by his owne will.</hi> You heare that God is the principall cauſe of faith, but not the totall, and that man doth ſeparate himſelfe by his owne will, when yet the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Who ſeparates thee?</hi> attributing this praiſe to God alone: And that the cauſe why of two that are alike called, one followeth, the other refuſeth, is in the one free-will, in the other grace indeede, but yet ſo that the vſe of it dependeth on mans free-will, in the power whereof it is to vſe grace or not to vſe it. So that in the one,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:11390:169"/>free-will is the totall cauſe of incredulitie, and in the other, it is the part-cauſe of faith and conuerſion: So that now man hath whereof he may boaſt; it is he that ſeparates himſelfe, and ſaluation is <hi>of man that willeth and runneth, and of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe innouators, that they might defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt that ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul; Who ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee?</hi> doe contend that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by which they that haue receiued many gifts, are ſeparated from them who haue receiued fewer, which I willingly receiue: For if by the grace of God alone, they which are indued with greater gifts, are ſeparated from the faithfull, who haue receiued fewer gifts, how much more are they who are furniſhed with many gifts ſeparated, by the mercy of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, from them who are altogether voide of Faith, and of the knowledge of God?</p>

               <p n="2">II. They doe euery where obiect and reckon vp that of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Gentiles which haue not the Law, doe by nature thoſe things contained in the Law.</hi> I anſwere, that by the Law it is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to loue God with all the heart, with all the ſtrength, which cannot be done vnleſſe you direct all your actions to his glory, and vnleſſe you be indued with faith, becauſe whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne: Whoſoeuer ſhalexamine the vertues of heathen men, by the line of theſe rules, ſhall finde that in their moſt honeſt deedes, there were many things wanting, and much ſinne in them: Hence it appeareth that the Gentiles indeede, in an externall worke, doe thoſe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:11390:170"/>things which are of the Law: The words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> are not to be extended any further: But the forme of a right worke, which is placed in the inward conueniency and agreement of the minde with the law of God, was alwaies abſent from infidels and heathen men. It is one thing to doe thoſe things that are of the law, it is another thing to fulfill the law: The one is to obey the law, as concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall matter of the worke, the other is to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the law, after that manner, with that minde, and to that end, which is commanded by the word of God.</p>
               <p n="3">III. They ſcatter ſome little motiues, as that, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55. <hi>v,</hi> 1. They that thirſt are inuited by God, <hi>that is,</hi> thoſe that are deſirous of reconciliation with God, and of ſaluation. And that <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. They that are heauy laden are called, <hi>Come vnto mee yee that are weary and heauie laden:</hi> By thoſe that are laden, are noted our, thoſe that are preſſed downe with the conſcience of their ſinnes, and ſighing vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them: Therefore (ſay they) they were already deſirous of ſaluation, and were preſſed downe with the conſcience of their ſins, before they were called, and regeneration is after calling: And therefore in the vnregenerate there may be a ſauing griefe, and a deſire of remiſſion of ſinnes; but I affirme that thoſe men ſo thirſting, and ſo laden, were not vnregenerate: For that very deſire of ſaluation and the grace of God, and the ſighes of the conſcience, panting vnder the weight of ſinne, by which wee are compelled to flie to Chriſt, is a part of regeneration: And that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of feare (if it be acceptable to God) is an effect
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:11390:171"/>of the holy ſpirit mouing the heart: For what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, that he who thirſteth after the grace of God, hath not already taſted of it, and as it were licked it with his lippes? What hindreth that he who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come to Chriſt, ſhould not already moue himſelfe and beginne to goe, although with a ſlow pace? Doth Chriſt as often as he commandeth men to beleeue in him, ſpeake onely to vnbeleeuers? Yea, this exhortation to beleeue, and to come to him, doth eſpecially belong to them, whoſe faith being new bred, and weake, doth ſtriue with the doubtings of the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is familiar to the <hi>Arminians</hi> to cite the words of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any one will doe the will of him that ſent me, hee ſhall know of my doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeake of my ſelfe.</hi> Hence they would proue, that one may doe the will of God, before he know Chriſt and his doctrine. This is to delude the Scripture, and to wreſt it at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: For they ſpeake, as if Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Hee that doth fulfill the commandements of God, ſhall afterward know of my doctrine, whether it be of God, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo by the words, <hi>to doe the will of God,</hi> they vnderſtand, to acknowledge their ſinnes, to feare God with a ſeruile and ſlauiſh feare, ſeriouſly to wiſh the grace of God, and remiſſion of ſinnes, to doe thoſe things which are of the law, &amp;c. All falſe: For to doe the will of God, in this place, is nothing elſe, then to beleeue Chriſt ſpeaking; for this is that which Chriſt doth vrge, that this is the will of the father, that we ſhould beleeue on the Sonne: Whoſe words if any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues, hee thereby knoweth that his doctrine is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:11390:171"/>heauenly and diuine, wherefore we are not to thinke that we doe the will of God before we beleeue in his Sonne. Thus, although it be true that he who is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued doth liue, yet it doth not thence follow, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is before life: So in that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoſoeuer will doe the will of the father, ſhall know that my doctrine is from God:</hi> It doth not thence follow, that the will of the father muſt be done before it can be knowne that his doctrine is from God: But if there is any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time here, it muſt needes be that the doctrine of Chriſt be firſt knowne to be from God, before he can be beleeued, or obeyed when he ſpeakes: For no man doth beleeue that which hee doth not in ſome part know. Chriſt followeth this order, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.8. <hi>They haue knowne that I came out from thee, and they haue beleeued that thou didst ſend mee.</hi> And, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.17. he ſaith, that the ſpirit of truth is not receiued by the world, becauſe the world doth not know him: To know therefore is before to receiue.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That is no better which <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth adde, <hi>Page</hi> 409. <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Prou.</hi> 1. And, <hi>The Lord reuealeth his ſecrets to them that feare him, Pſal.</hi> 25. But I deny that the feare of the Lord, of which it is ſpoken here, can agree to vnbeleeuers and vnregenerate men. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, that the feare of the Lord, is the <hi>head</hi> of wiſedome, <hi>that is,</hi> the chiefe part, and that wherein wiſedome doth chiefely conſiſt, for this the Hebrew word, <hi>Reſhith,</hi> doth plainely ſignifie: And thoſe that feare God, to whom he reuealeth his ſecrets, are not vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſons, but thoſe which are truely godly, to whom hee doth daily giue increaſe of wiſedome,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:11390:172"/>and of the true knowledge of God.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. To the ſame end <hi>Arnoldus, Page</hi> 397. doth bring the words of the 51. <hi>Pſalme, A contrite ſpirit is an acceptable ſacrifice to God.</hi> And, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66. <hi>God will dwell in a contrite ſpirit. Arnoldus</hi> thinketh that theſe things are ſpoken of an vnregenerate man, but yet ſuch a one as doth confeſſe his ſinnes, doth grieue, hath the beginning of feare, &amp;c. But hee eyther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues or is deceiued: For there <hi>Dauid</hi> lamenting his ſinnes, with a large confeſſion, doth comfort himſelfe with this hope, and doth promiſe to himſelfe that his contrition will be an acceptable ſacrifice to God. Whoſoeuer therefore doth ſay that <hi>Dauid</hi> there ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the contrition of an vnregenerate man, doth affirme that <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe was vnregenerate: And there is no man but ſeeth, that <hi>Eſay</hi> doth ſpeake of them that are truely faithfull, and of a filiall feare and contrition, and not of that feare which may be in the vnregenerate, and in the heathen, who haue not heard the word of God. For the Prophet ſaith, <hi>To whom ſhall I looke? To him that is afflicted and of a contrite heart, and trembleth at my word:</hi> Hee ſpeaketh of the man who is inſtructed in the word of God, and who with a holy feare is moued to the hearing of it.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> a little before, had reckoned vp the good workes which may be done by an vnregenerate man, <hi>viz.</hi> To doe thoſe things which are of the law, to haue ſome ſparkes of light and knowledge engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen on his heart, to grieue for his ſinnes, to implore the grace of remiſſion of ſinnes, and of the new ſpirit: But how many nations are there, who doe not know
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:11390:172"/>what this new ſpirit is, nor haue euer heard any thing of the grace of remiſſion of ſins? Alſo I would know whether ſuch things that are done by the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, without faith, are truely good: If they be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, then we can doe that which is truely good without Chriſt, without his ſpirit, and without faith: If they are not truely good, how can that not be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good and iuſt, which God alone intendeth, and which alone, nothing more (if <hi>Arminius</hi> be beleeued) he doth require from the vnregenerate man as long as he is vnregenerate?</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. A little after, he ſaith, that the ſame worke cannot be performed as perfect in its eſſence, without the faith of Chriſt; and he doth put this difference betweene workes which are done before regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they which are done after regeneration; <hi>to wit,</hi> that they are imperfect, theſe are perfect. Theſe are the two kindes of merits, with which, in the Schooles of the Papiſts, make ſuch a noyſe, merits of congruity, and merits of condignity, but new dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and cloathed with other names. The Reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall note, that the <hi>Arminians</hi> place in a regenerate man perfect workes, and a perfect loue of God: For they thinke <hi>that the regenerate, may by the ſpirit of Chriſt ſo conforme their life, according to that law, that they may come to that degree of obedience which God doth require of them.</hi> Theſe are the words of <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 492. and <hi>pag.</hi> 399. according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> he ſaith, that there is a double ſpirit, one that doth goe before regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and doth tend to it, which is the ſpirit of bondage to feare, the other which doth regenerate, and doth <hi>perfect</hi> regeneration. <hi>Arminius, Reſp. ad.</hi> 31. <hi>Art. pa.</hi> 164.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:11390:173"/>and 165. <hi>I doe not repugne that opinion of</hi> Auſtin, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he determines, that man may be without ſinne in this life.</hi> Truely it is boldly ſpoken: The <hi>Arminians</hi> then are better then the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi> who ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> In which ſpeech, he doth account himſelfe among them who offend in many things: Better then Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> whoſe confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this; <hi>If we ſay we haue no ſinne, wee deceiue our ſelues, and the truth is not in vs:</hi> Yea, better then all the Apoſtles, who did daily ſay, <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes.</hi> Neither is it to be maruailed at, if the <hi>Arminians</hi> thinke that the regenerate can fulfill the Law, ſeeing they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſay, that the Law of nature may be fulfilled by the heathen and vnregenerate: Now the Law of nature is that, to which <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall ſtood bound, which bond paſſed to his poſteritie: This Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids a man to lye; but the Scripture, that cannot lye, ſaith, that euery man is a lyar: The ſame Law, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth that God be loued withall our heart, and all our ſtrength; which thing, how can it be performed by the vnregenerate, ſeeing it was neuer peeformed by the regenerate themſelues? That which a liuing man neuer performed, how can it be performed by him that is dead?

And if it be ſo in the vices of the body, into which, when any one hath fallen by his owne fault, hee doth wiſh he had not fallen into them, and would redeeme it with a great price; how much more is it in the vices of the minde, which ſeeing they are procured by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and generation, are loued by him who is volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily euill?

For (as <hi>Arminius</hi> confeſſeth) it were not ſinne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ſinned freely. But perhaps <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus</hi> are of opinion, that God taketh that neceſſity of ſinning from all men: Let vs therefore heare what <hi>Arnoldus</hi> in the ſame place doth adde: <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth determine that God is prepared, for his part, to take away that neceſsity of ſinning.</hi> In which words he doth not obſcurely confeſſe that God doth not take that neceſſity from all, but that he is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to take it away, if themſelues will; but that hee doth not take it away from all, is our owne fault; as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> himſelfe doth acknowledge, <hi>Page</hi> 398. The ſame man, <hi>Page</hi> 399. according to <hi>Arminius</hi> doth ſay, <hi>That God by little and little, by the grace of his ſpirit, doth free men from this neceſsity of ſinning:</hi> It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſently taken away; yea it remaineth alwaies in them in whom the grace of the holy Ghoſt, eyther doth not worke, or doth not preuaile.

               <p n="6">VI. Nay, more then this, the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe ſay, that God doth vnreſiſtably harden ſome men? For I vſe their owne words. Now there is nothing more euident, then that he doth neceſſarily ſinne, who is vnreſiſtably hardned: We haue therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of theſe Sectaries, that there are ſome who ſinne neceſſarily, and whom the neceſſity of ſinning doth not excuſe from their ſinne, becauſe they haue contracted this neceſſity to themſelues by their owne fault.</p>

               <p n="8">VIII. We determine therefore, that the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſinne doth excuſe from ſinne, if he that ſinneth hath not procured this neceſſity of ſinning by his owne fault. As alſo if by neceſſity, conſtraint and a greater force of the outward agent be vnderſtood, or a naturall neceſſity appointed to ſome one thing by the creator, and being voide of knowledge, ſuch as is the naturall inclination of heauy things to the center

               <p n="9">IX. And that which the Sectaries ſay, that there is no place for puniſhment, if man want the liberty of his free-will, may be admitted, if by libertie of free-will be vnderſtood, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="11">XI. I anſwere to theſe things, that precepts, threates, and counſels, &amp;c. are in vaine, if man wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the faculty of vnderſtanding, and of willing or nilling ſomething of his owne accord, and with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and iudgement. But an vnregenerate man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with vnderſtanding, and hath a will which is moued of its owne accord and incitation, and after fore-going knowledge and practicall iudgement. Nor is it alwaies true, that thoſe precepts are giuen in vaine which cannot be fulfilled: For the intemperate man, who by cuſtome hath brought on himſelfe inſenſibleneſſe, and cannot temper himſelfe from luſt and ſurfeiting, is yet tyed by the lawes of ſobrietie and temperance. Neither is it any doubt, but that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:11390:179"/>the diuell, who is neceſſarily euill, and vnfit to yeelde obedience to God, is bound to obey God; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſhould not ſinne in being an enemy to God: So from a debtor, which hath conſumed at dice a great ſome of money which he tooke vp at vſe, that which he oweth is not in vaine nor vniuſtly required, nor can the creditor loſe his right by the wickedneſſe of the debtor. Seeing therefore, that man by his owne fault procured on himſelfe the diſability of performing that which God would haue done, God doth not vainely and vniuſtly require from him the obedience which he oweth: For it is not equall that the ſinne of man ſhould profit him, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould be lawleſſe, becauſe he corrupted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his owne wickedneſſe, and brought vpon himſelfe the diſability of paying to God the debt of nature, which God doth require of man, conſidered not as a ſinner, nor yet as iuſt, but ſimply as hee is a debtor, and in as much as he is a creature ſubiect and bound to obedience. After the ſame manner, that a creditour requiring his debt, doth not conſider the debtor as he is poore, or as he is rich, but ſimply as he is a debtor: God making his law, doth conſider man after this manner, and ſo he doth conſider him, when he doth adde promiſes and threates to the Law, ſaying, <hi>Doe this, and thou ſhalt liue. And chooſe good, that thou maiſt liue, &amp;c. And make ye a new heart, for why will ye die O houſe of Iſraell? Ezech.</hi> 18. He is deceiued, ſurely he is deceiued; who thinketh that the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God are the meaſure of our ſtrength, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are the rule of our dutie: For in the law we doe not learne what we are able to doe, but what wee
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:11390:179"/>ought to doe; nor what now we are able, but what heretofore we were able to doe, and from what a height of iuſtice we fell by the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII. The Scripture doth ſupply moſt forcible proofes for this thing. Saint <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 2.12. doth command vs to worke out our ſaluation with feare and trembling; but preſently after leſt it ſhould be thought that this can be performed by vs, becauſe it is commanded, he doth adde; <hi>It is God which worketh in you both to will and to doe, of his good pleaſure.</hi> Thus <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit.</hi> But leſt any ſhould thinke that this is a thing of our free-will, in the thirty ſixt Chapter of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, God ſpeaketh thus: <hi>I will take away the ſtony heart out of you, fleſh, and giue you a new heart.</hi> Thus <hi>Ioel</hi> 11. <hi>Be ye conuerted to mee with your whole heart;</hi> yet <hi>Ieremy, Chap.</hi> 31.18. doth acknowledge that the conuerſion of a ſinner is the gift of God; <hi>Turne mee O Lord, and I ſhall be turned.</hi> And the laſt of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, Turne vs O Lord, and we ſhall be turned.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.16. God doth thus ſpeake to the people: <hi>Circumciſe the fore-skinne of your heart;</hi> yet <hi>Chapter</hi> 30.6. it is declared who doth worke it: <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart.</hi> Thus Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.1. commands vs to beleeue in him, and yet hee ſaith, no man can come to him, except the father draw him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6 44. and that by comming hee meaneth belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, he himſelfe teacheth, <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>He that commeth to me ſhall not hunger, and he that beleeueth in me ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thirſt.</hi> And, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. wee are taught that faith, and the act of beleeuing is from God. Finally, the Scripture will haue men to gaine their bread by
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:11390:180"/>the ſweat and labour of their hands, and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, wee are commanded to aske our daily bread of God, becauſe the foode of the body, is the gift of God, but that which hee doth giue to him that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: For the bleſſing of God doth not come on idleneſſe, but on labour. That I may not ſay many things: Doth not God require perfect obedience from the vnregenerate? Yes, and from the heathen, to whom Chriſt was neuer knowne: And yet if one ſhould ſay that they might be perfectly iuſt, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without ſinne, he ſhould attribute that to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers, which neuer happened to any faithfull man. Doth not <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe acknowledge that ſome are vnreſiſtably hardned, from whom yet God doth require perfect obedience?</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Neither doth God therefore command in vaine, or are his precepts to no purpoſe: For God in commanding, exhorting, threatning, &amp;c. doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man with the ſence of his ſinne; hee doth teach man his debt; what once hee could doe, and whence he fell: Alſo he doth propound a rule of iuſtice, leſt any one ſhould pretend ignorance for his ſinnes: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he doth ioyne to his word the efficacy of the ſpirit, and he doth, as it were, arme and head it, and make it ſharpe and effectuall. It is not in vaine to command him that is fettered to runne, if by that commandement his fetters are looſed. It is not in vaine to command a blinde man to ſee, if by thoſe words wherewith this is commanded, the eyes of him that is blinde are opened: For the words of God doe work that in vs, which they command vs to do: They doe ſo command that they doe alſo worke; as his
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:11390:180"/>words in the creation: God commandeth that which he would haue done, but hee giueth alſo that which he commandeth: and it is profitable for man to be preſſed downe with the intollerable burthen of the Law, which doth exceede his ſtrength, that he might the more couetouſly embrace the remedies offred in Chriſt. Excellently to this purpoſe Saint <hi>Auſtin, lib. de corrept. &amp; gratia. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>O man, in the commandement know what thou oughteſt to doe: in the word of correction and reproofe, know that by thine owne fault thou haſt not that thou oughteſt to haue: in prayer, know whence thou mayeſt receiue what thou wouldſt haue.</hi> And in his booke, <hi>de ſpiritu &amp; litera. God doth not meaſure his precepts by the strength of man, but where he commands that which is right, hee doth freely giue to his elect ability of fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The ſimilitudes which theſe Sectaries vſe to procure enuie to vs, are plainly contrary, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe: They ſay, it is to no purpoſe to blame the blinde man, becauſe he doth not ſee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he hath pulled out his owne eyes; or to vrge him to worke, who hath cut off his owne hands. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him that is blinde, I anſwere, that this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is brought by them vnproperly; for no blinde man, whether he is blinde by his owne fault, or by anothers, is bound to ſee: But hee that by his owne fault, is made wicked, and vnable to obey God, is yet bound to obey him: No man is bound to exerciſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall functions after they haue ceaſed; but the bond whereby the creature is bound to the Creator, can be wiped out by no occaſion, much leſſe by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man. But if any blinde man, had rather be
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:11390:181"/>blinde, then ſee, and ſhould refuſe the remedies offred, ſhould he not iuſtly be blamed? Such is the condition of man in the ſtate of ſinne; for he is not onely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily euill, but he will not be good, and he is delighted with his wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The ſimilitude of him who hath willingly cut off his owne hands, hath the ſame defects; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto this is to be added; that the hands may be cut off, but the will, which is here ſignified by the hands, cannot be cut off: For euery moſt wicked man, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a will, by which hee is alwayes bound to worſhip and loue God, although he hath corrupted it. Finally, the ſimilitudes of naturall and ciuill things, are for the moſt part very vnfitly and abſurdly drawn to morall things, and to religion. By the like reaſon, that ridiculous ſimilitude of a man ſpeaking to dry bones is diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">II. Furthermore, although the knowledge of the creatures doth not ſuffice to ſaluation, yet the Gentiles, who were inſtructed by no other teacher then nature, are therefore inexcuſable, becauſe they doe not vſe theſe (although ſmall) helpes, to as good purpoſe as
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:11390:183"/>they might: and becauſe they endeauour to choake or depraue thoſe naturall good notions, and ſparkes of goodneſſe and equity, which are put into them by nature: Therefore they alone doe profit in piety, by the teaching of the creatures, and are by the prickes of conſcience ſtirred vp to the feare of God, to whom God hath vouchſafed the prerogatiue of his word.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But yet not all they that heare the word of God, doe come to ſaluation; but thoſe in whom the preaching of the Goſpell piercing deepely, and being admitted into them, doth change their hearts, and ſhed in their mindes a heauenly light: And theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing effects, are not to be aſcribed to the eloquence of man, obtained to perſwade, but to the ſecret efficacy of the holy Ghoſt, which is the true doctor of our ſoules, and that ſinger of God, engrauing the law on the ſtony tables of our hearts. Thence it is, that the Goſpell is called in the Scripture a two-edged ſword, a hammer breaking the ſtone, the arme of God, and the power of God to ſaluation: Without which efficacy of the holy Ghoſt, preaching is but a dead letter, and a vaine ſound ſtriking mens eares; effectuall onely to this, that the condemnation of the ſtubborne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious hearer, ſhould be the greater.</p>
               <p>Hence ariſeth a double calling, one outward, which is wrought by the outward publiſhing of the Goſpell; the other inward, which is wrought by the powerfull drawing and change of the heart by the Holy-Ghoſt, by whom the word is made effectuall. This inward change doth conſiſt of two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The enlightning of the minde, and the change of the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:11390:183"/>will, which change of the will, though it be latter in time, yet it is worthier in dignity: In ſo much that the enlightning of the minde, without the renewing of the heart, doth turne to our greater condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This inward change is in the Scripture called conuerſion, regeneration, the new birth, creation, and reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Here wee haue ſomewhat to doe with the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and there is no ſmall controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs: For they ſay, that the word of God, whenſoeuer, and amongſt whomſoeuer it is preached, is neuer deſtitute of its quickning power, neither is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one outwardly called, but hee is alſo inwardly drawne: And therefore they refuſe the diſtinction of vocation or calling, into outward and inward. Theſe are the words of <hi>Arminius</hi> againſt <hi>Perkins, Page</hi> 57. <hi>The word is vnprofitable without the Holy-Ghoſt, wherefore it hath the cooperation of the Holy-Ghoſt alwaies ioyned to it:</hi> And this he ſaith being vnminde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of that which hee had ſaid a little before, where ſpeaking of the word, and of the cooperation of the holy ſpirit, he ſaith; <hi>theſe two are almoſt alwayes ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together,</hi> therefore not alwayes: Neither is <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noldus</hi> vnwilling that <hi>Arminius</hi> ſhould doubt in that thing; for, <hi>pag.</hi> 432. he ſpeaketh thus; <hi>It may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether</hi> Arminius <hi>thought that the inward ſuccour of the ſpirit was alwaies, and in all men, ioyned with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preaching:</hi> But that which the Maſter ſpeakes fearefully and doubtingly, is openly and without any circumſtance affirmed by his ſchollers. For <hi>Arnoldus, Chap.</hi> 4. would draw <hi>Arminius</hi> into this opinion, <hi>that the outward calling doth happen to none, without the

Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 464: teacheth, that this quickning force is ioyned, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the preaching of the Goſpell, but alſo to the preaching of the law, and that this change is made by the ſpirit, by the word of the Law, <hi>preparatorily, and by way of preparation;</hi> by the word of the Goſpell, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatorily, in reſpect of the finiſhing of it; and that ſo, as man cannot but receiue that ſence, and be affected with it, and in this action the ſpirit carrieth himſelfe altogether paſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uely:</hi> By which feeing, hee ſaith, the ſpirit doth allure the aſſent, the liberty of the will yet remaining ſafe and whole. This holy ſpirit working in mens hearts, by the knowledge of the law, <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth put, euen in Infidels and thoſe that be not regenerate; which although it is not the ſpirit of regeneration, yet it doth diſpoſe to regeneration.</p>
               <p n="5">V. This doctrine is repugnant, not onely to the holy Scripture, but alſo to experience and common ſence: For we ſee many hearers of the word, that are no more affected with the preaching of it, then if leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould be ſung to them that are deafe; thoſe whoſe mindes doth wander other-where, and doth neuer returne; beſotted with ſuch a ſtupidity, that they haue no reliſh of the Goſpell, no feeling of it, nor aſſent vnto it, although to other things they are not ſlow: Alſo there are very many, who when they heare the Goſpell, receiue it with gibing &amp; laughter, as
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:11390:184"/>an abſurd thing, as the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 13.32. For Chriſt preached <hi>is an offence to the Iewes, and fooliſhneſſe to the Greekes,</hi> becauſe they are offended, and theſe mocke at it. I haue ſeene thoſe, who being asked what they brought from the Sermon, and what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, haue ſeriouſly anſwered, they could not diſcerne whether the Preacher ſpoke French or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. In ſuch men, yea, and in Infidels, inſtructed in the law alone, the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay, that the ſpirit of God doth worke, and doth neceſſarily, and (as they ſpeake) vnreſiſtably, giue the ſence and feeling of the true doctrine, although he doth not giue the aſſent and agreeing to it, but by the helpe of free-will. Much more therefore among the <hi>Arminian</hi> multitude, there will be none, who is not drawne with the holy Ghoſt, and who doth not feele in him the quickning ſpirit: This flying in the ayre, doth not much diſſer from the fanaticall enthuſiaſme and inſpiration of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, but that the Anabaptiſts will haue this ſence and feeling peculiar to themſelues; but theſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uators will haue it to be common, both to the faithfull and to Infidels, yea to all, to whom either the Goſpell is preached, or the Law without the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. It is to no purpoſe, to reckon vp places of Scripture, to ouerthrow this opinion: For hitherto belong all thoſe places which wee haue brought, Chapter 34. to proue that an vnregenerate man, and an infidell, is vnable and vnfit to euery worke that is good and profitable to ſaluation: All which were falſe, if the quickning power of the holy ſpirit, did
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:11390:185"/>dwell in infidels, and vnregenerate perſons, and if all men were drawne inwardly, and by an internall calling.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. To this purpoſe are thoſe places which teach vs, that they alone come to Chriſt whom the father draweth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44. But according to <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> all men are drawne, and are inwardly affected, by the holy Ghoſt: <hi>As the winde bloweth where it liſteth, ſo alſo the ſpirit, Iohn</hi> 3.8. Therefore hee doth not breath euery where. In the multitude of people God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> before the reſt: When the Apoſtles were aſtoniſhed, the theefe beleeued among the cries of the raging people, and ſo many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of beleeuing: One little call of Chriſt moued <hi>Mathew,</hi> that leauing the receipt of Cuſtome he follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed Chriſt; when the men of Capernaum, among ſo many miracles and good leſſons, were hardned at the preaching of the Goſpell: Whence it appeareth, that ſome men are drawne by the efficacy and power of the ſpirit, and ſome men are left in their naturall wickedneſſe. Whence is this difference? If dignity be reſpected, who among the vnregenerate is not vnworthy of the grace of God, ſeeing all men are of a ſtony heart, and are dead in ſinne? But if the precedent diſpoſition be reſpected, why are the men of Capernaum rather called by the Goſpell, then the men of Tyre, ſeeing that Chriſt doth witneſſe that the men of Capernaum were worſe affected, and leſſe inclined to repentance.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Arnoldus, Page</hi> 445. doth contend, that the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> was therefore opened, becauſe ſhee was well affected and diſpoſed, and that God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:11390:185"/>opened her heart, becauſe ſhe opened it her ſelfe: For in that place ſhee is called, <gap reason="foreign">

Nor is it any doubt but that God doth ſeriouſly call men: For in calling men, bee doth ſeriouſly declare what is acceptable to him, what man doth owe, and what he will giue to them that beleeue and obey. But wee doe not ſay with <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> that God is bound to reſtore to man thoſe powers which he loſt, and to cure that diſability of man, which man brought vpon himſelfe. Furthermore, it is wicked audacity to goe about to preſcribe meanes to God, which vnleſſe he follow, hee hath no way to eſcape the crime of iniuſtice, as if he ſhould be compelled to pleade his cauſe before the tribunall of man.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> proceedeth. <hi>The ſame thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God doth teach, when he doth expreſly declare, that he will not be loaden with this vniuſt ſuſpition; that hee ſhould require any thing of vs, to the performance whereof he would not giue vs ſufficient power.</hi> I omit that rude
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:11390:188"/>kinde of ſpeaking, and which is not agreeing to God, when he ſaith, that <hi>God will not be loaden with that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt ſuſpition;</hi> as if God feared the vniuſt ſuſpitions of men. To the thing it ſelfe therefore I ſay, that this doctrine is moſt wicked, and there is ſcarce any that is worſe: For ſeeing God doth require from vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men and Infidels, their naturall debt, <hi>that is,</hi> the perfect fulfilling of the Law; it followeth by this ſpeech of <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> that the vnregenerate, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels themſelues haue power, by which, without the knowledge of Chriſt, and without faith, they may perfectly fulfill the Law, and be without ſinne. The <hi>Arminians</hi> themſelues, doe ſay that God doth vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtably harden ſome men; who although they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſinne, yet from them, being hardned, God doth not leſſe require perfect obedience, then before their hardning: For the creature is by no means, no not by the eternall puniſhments, exempted from his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to his creator. Nor is it to be doubted, but that the Diuels themſelues, who are in eternall torments, are bound to beleeue God; for they are therefore pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, becauſe they doe not loue him. Alſo, if any one be puniſhed for diſobedience paſt, he is not therefore freed from the obedience that is due for the time to come.</p>
               <p>But this peruerſe doctrine, which doth gather by the commandements of God, what are the powers of men; and doth thinke that there is nothing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God, to the fulfilling whereof powers are not ſupplied to man, is at large confuted in the 35.

               <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He diſtinction of grace into ſufficient and into effectuall grace, is an old &amp; worne diſtinction in the Schooles: But effectuall grace is taken two wayes. For it doth either ſignifie, that grace which is apt and fit to effect and worke; as when we call that medicine effectuall, and that reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy forcible, which although it be not taken by the ſicke man yet is apt and fit to heale: Or we call that grace effectuall, which doth effect and worke in act; in which ſence, effectuall is vſed for efficient, and the efficacy is vſed for the effect, or for the efficiency. The Philoſophers ſay, that there is a double efficient cauſe, one in power, as the Architect and the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; another in act, as hee that buildeth, and hee that cureth: Hence proceedeth that double acceptation of the word, <hi>efficacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The Papiſts thinke, that there is ſufficient aide to conuerſion giuen to all men: with which aide, they may ſo cooperate with the helpe of their free-will, that they may be conuerted, although there come no other effectuall aide: And by effectuall grace, they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that grace which is efficient, and doth bring forth its effect.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Arminians,</hi> who in the queſtion of grace and free-will, doe ſo dreſſe and trimme vp Popery, as the Papiſts doe Pelagianiſme, doe often vſe that
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:11390:189"/>diſtinction of ſufficient and effectuall grace; but with ſuch a floating ſpeech, and affected ambiguity, that it is hard to know what is effectuall grace with them. <hi>Arminius</hi> againſt <hi>Perkins, pag.</hi> 245. doth ſay, that that is effectuall grace, which doth in very deede worke the effect; and hee doth bring theſe examples: God was able to make many worlds, but hee did it not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; Chriſt was able to ſaue all men, but he did it not effectually: Which ſpeech is certainely abſurd, and deſerueth to be laughed at; for he ſpeaketh, as if God did ſomething not effectually, or as if hee had created many worlds ineffectually: For in ſtead of <hi>to doe effectually,</hi> hee ought to haue ſimply ſaid, <hi>to doe, or to make.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. But <hi>Arnoldus</hi> being as <hi>Diomedes, melior patre,</hi> better then his father, doth forſake <hi>Arminius:</hi> For he, <hi>pag.</hi> 397. hath theſe words; <hi>That thing is ſaid to be effectuall, not which doth effect any thing, but which is ſo powerfull to doe ſomething, as is an effectuall remedy, and forcible meanes.</hi> Thus the Patrons of errour, are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out betweene themſelues. But here I am bound to patronize and maintaine <hi>Arminius</hi> againſt his Scholler: For if effectuall grace be taken for that which doth effect and worke in act, then this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace into ſufficient and effectuall may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; becauſe there are many things of ſufficient power to worke, which yet doe not worke in act; as the abſent Phyſitian, and the ſleeping Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: But it cannot be ſaid, that one grace is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to worke, and another is fit and apt to worke, for theſe two are both one; neither can any thing be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more abſurd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, then that there is ſome grace
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:11390:190"/>ſufficient, which is not fit to worke: That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an efficient cauſe, which is not of ſufficient power.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Therefore according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> the meanes to faith and ſaluation are adminiſtred to all ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not effectually and efficiently. But according to <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> God doth adminiſter theſe meanes to all men, both ſufficiently and effectually; for he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take efficacy for aptitude and fitneſſe to worke, then for efficiency and the working it ſelfe; that he might ſay, that the efficacy of grace doth not depend on free-will: For if he had taken efficacy for efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then he muſt haue ſaid, that the efficacy of grace doth depend on free-will: For the Schoole and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Arminius,</hi> doe hold this by the teeth, and doe cry out with one mouth, that the effect or effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of grace, doth depend on free-will. God indeede doth giue grace and ſufficient power to conuerſion, but that man is conuerted, or not conuerted in act, is in the power of free-will. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth teach this at large, 447. <hi>We determine</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that the vſe of grace is ſubiect to mans will, ſo that man may vſe it, or not vſe it, according to his naturall liberty:</hi> And a little after, ſpeaking of a man furniſhed with the power of grace, hee ſaith, that <hi>the effect of the mercy of God, is in the power of man.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 448. he teacheth, that if effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy be taken for efficiency, man maketh grace inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall: For <hi>Arnoldus</hi> was aſhamed to adde the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member, and to ſay that man made grace effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or ineffectuall; and yet there are other places brought by vs out of their writings, which are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent and of like force with this ſpeech: as alſo that
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:11390:190"/>which he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 449. <hi>Man, if he be not wanting to himſelfe, may conuert himſelfe.</hi> The Reader therefore ſhall marke how peſtilent this doctrine is (which the <hi>ARminians,</hi> reſtrained as it were with ſhame, doe ſcarce at any time vtter without ambiguities;) <hi>That the grace of God is effectuall</hi> (that is, <hi>efficient and working,) it is to be attributed to free-will, and the efficiency of the grace of God is ſubiected to the will of man.</hi> By which ſpeech they meane this; that God doth ſaue man, if man himſelfe will, for this it is to depend on mans will.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Orthodoxe Churches doe much differ from this doctrine: For how can we be conuerted by the grace of God, if wee will, ſeeing that this very thing that we are willing, is the grace of God, yea, it is conuerſion it ſelfe? For he that doth ſeriouſly deſire to be conuerted to God, is already in ſome part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. But of theſe things we haue already ſpoken much, and more ſhall be ſpoken, when wee treate of the manner by which the grace of God doth certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke conuerſion in vs, which manner, the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> call (by an odious and rude word) irreſiſtibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. But in the tearme of ſufficient grace, they doe not onely differ one from another, but euery one of them differeth from himſelfe: For they will haue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grace to beleeue, &amp; power of beleeuing to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to all particular men.

And we acknowledge that there is no grace abſolutely ſufficient, eyther to conuerſion, or to faith, or to ſaluation, without the ſpirit of regeneration, and knowledge of Chriſt. And we condemne the ſchoole of <hi>Arminius,</hi> teaching that all men, euen the heathens, to whom the name of Chriſt hath not come, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſufficient and ſauing grace, to come to faith, and by it to ſaluation.</p>

Yet the outward meanes to ſaluation, that are largely adminiſtred without the inward efficacy of the holy Spirit, may in ſome meaſure be called ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace, not onely becauſe they ſuffice to make them inexcuſable, but alſo becauſe theſe meanes ought to ſuffice to come to ſaluation, if man were ſuch as he ought to be. For if any thing is wanting to that grace, the defect is bred on his part who is called, not on his part who calleth, who, by the rule of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, is not bound to ſupply inward diſpoſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man is bound to giue them of his owne, and to bring them of himſelfe: Nor is God bound to reſtore
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:11390:192"/>them to man, after man hath loſt them by his owne fault: Therefore God doth iuſtly ſay, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. <hi>What ought I to haue done more to my vineyard, that I haue not done to it?</hi> For, ſpeaking after the manner of men, God is ſaid that he ought to doe that which his iuſtice doth require, and which if he ſhould not doe, there would ſeeme to be cauſe of expoſtulating: But that God doth there ſpeake of the outward meanes, doth hence appeare, becauſe he compareth the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits beſtowed vpon Iſrael, to a planting in a fruitfull place, to a digging, to fencing with a hedg, to gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out ſtones, and to the building of a Tower: But there is no mention of the ſecret vegetation and growth of it, of the fauourable fitneſſe of the ayre, of the ſeaſonable raine, which are things rather of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſecret power. Furthermore to that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereby it is demanded, whether God doth giue to ſeuerall men ſufficient grace, this place of the fift of <hi>Eſay</hi> is not properly brought; where it is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of that ſufficient grace which God doth offer or giue to ſeuerall men, but of that which he giueth to a whole nation: For the gift of the ſpirit and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of beleeuing, which <hi>Arminius</hi> will haue to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſeuerall men, is a gift which is giuen to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men ſeuerally, and not to a whole nation taken together.

It cannot be ſaid how much theſe things doe differ from Chriſtian modeſty: Surely if thoſe things were true which they affirme, it were the part of pious and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men to keepe in theſe things, leſt they ſhould ſeeme to goe about, eyther to preſcribe ſomething to God in the worke of ſaluation, or to put God in mind of his dutie.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. This doctrine doth reſt on two falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Firſt; that God doth require nothing of man, which cannot be performed by man. Secondly; that the condition of the new couenant, <hi>that is,</hi> Faith, is not commanded by the law, nor is a naturall debt, and that the power of beleeuing is not loſt by the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> The former of which principles is drawne out of the dregges of <hi>Pelagianiſme,</hi> and is refuted by
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:11390:194"/>vs, in the 44. and 35. <hi>Chapter:</hi> The latter we haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne in the whole eleauenth <hi>Chapter.</hi> The law is the naturall debt of man: This law comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that God be loued and worſhipped, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand alſo that hee be beleeued, ſpeaking and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: Therefore when man by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> loſt the power of obeying God, and of louing him, he loſt alſo the powers of beleeuing his promiſes. When God doth require this faith of man, hee doth require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what man doth owe, and hee is not bound to reſtore to man thoſe powers of be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">VIII. But when they come to explaine the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this vniuerſall grace, they doe very little differ from the <hi>Pelagians:</hi> For <hi>Pelagius,</hi> leſt he ſhould ſeeme to be an enemy to grace, doth aſcribe to it euery good worke that is done by man: But by grace hee did vnderſtand nature it ſelfe, becauſe it had beene made and created by God: But according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> nature is one thing, vniuerſall Grace is another: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he will haue ſufficient grace to be giuen to all &amp; particular men, and that nature is in no man to whom God doth not giue ſufficient grace to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine faith, and by faith ſaluation; whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that according to <hi>Arminius,</hi> ſufficient grace doth extend it ſelfe as farre as nature. <hi>Pelagius</hi> doth confound nature with grace; but <hi>Arminius</hi> doth ioyne nature and grace together, ſo that nature is in none, to whom grace is not giuen; which grace
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:11390:195"/>how little it doth differ from nature, doth hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, in that the <hi>Arminians</hi> will haue the right vſe of this grace to be nothing elſe then the right vſe of that naturall light and knowledge which is engrafted in euery one, by the contemplation of the creatures, and by the law of nature; ſo that the vſe and office of grace and nature is altogether the ſame; when rather the Scripture teacheth that the right vſe of grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the change of nature. If theſe things are true, all the arguments both of vs and of the auncients doe fall to the ground, by which they doe proue that the grace of God is a thing diuerſe from nature, and that becauſe nature is giuen to all, and the grace of God is the priuiledge but of ſome: For <hi>Arminius</hi> will haue ſufficient grace to faith, and by faith to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be common to all men.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 418. doth call that ſufficient grace which is giuen to all men ſupernaturall grace, leſt hee ſhould ſeeme to confound it with nature; but a little after he addeth; <hi>It is demanded, whether that grace be not preſent to all men, by which they may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe that light of nature, not yet reſtored to the integrity thereof, as reliques and remainds of that light,</hi> that is, <hi>may worſhip God according to the meaſure of thoſe remainds.</hi> Doe you heare that all men haue that grace whereby they may rightly vſe nature, and worſhip God; and that that grace is preſent with all men, and therefore alſo to Infidels, and to the vnregenerate, and to them that know not Chriſt: and that the power of that grace which is common to all men, is placed in the right vſe of nature? The ſame man, <hi>pag.</hi> 405 doth ſay, <hi>It is the property of generall grace, that men ſhould be able
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:11390:195"/>rightly to vſe thoſe gifts:</hi> And hee ſpeaketh of the gifts of nature.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The ſame man, <hi>pag.</hi> 112. ſpeaking of vniuerſall grace, doth ſay, that there is a certaine calling which is common, and that there are common documents &amp; inſtructions of nature, by which God doth call all men whatſoeuer, to ſome meaſure of the knowledge of himſelfe, and doth leaue them gifts according to the meaſure of the calling.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Yet he denieth, that of this common grace, which is giuen to all, by which all men may rightly vſe the gifts of nature, that it will follow he reof, that grace and nature are of an equall extent: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>although it be in the power of generall grace, that all men may rightly vſe thoſe gifts, yet it is from ſpeciall grace that they may rightly vſe them in act: For that power is not brought into act, but by the helpe of another ſubſequent and following grace, which is ſpeciall, becauſe it doth not happen to all.</hi> This learned man, ſurely hath aſſigned and ſet downe, a fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which is as much as if I ſhould ſay, that the ſeeing faculty in man doth not extend as farre as mans nature, becauſe it hath neede of the light of the ſunne, that it may ſee in act, as if that which doth want the helpe of ſome thing, may not extend it ſelfe as farre as nature: There is ſcarce any naturall faculty, which can worke without the helpe of ſome other faculty, or of ſome inward or outward aide; and ſo there will be nothing at all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall in man. I omit that <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth ſtrike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

                  <hi>It is giuen to you to know the ſecrets of the Kingdome of heauen, but it is not giuen to them:</hi> Doth he not ſay that the grace of knowing the ſecrets of the kingdome of heauen, is not at all giuen to ſome? &amp; yet without this grace, all other grace is vnprofitable to ſaluation.

               <p n="16">XVI.

For he thinketh but ill of God, who teacheth that God doth ſeriouſly deſire all men to be ſaued, and to that end doth giue to all men ſufficient grace, whereby they may be conuerted and beleeue, but hee doth ſo ſparingly adminiſter this grace, that of infinite milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſcarce one or two hath by this ſufficient grace, conuerted himſelfe and come to faith.</p>

Alſo by this meanes the benefits of God are leſſened, and made very ſmall: For (if theſe ſectaries

               <p n="3">III. The ſame doctrine determining that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grace is giuen to the Gentiles which haue not knowne Chriſt, that according to the meaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they may worſhip God, doth plainely ſay, that there is a worſhip which may be acceptable to God without Chriſt, and without faith.

               <p n="4">IV. With a like error doe the <hi>Arminians</hi> thinke that the power of beleeuing and obtaining faith, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to man without the ſpirit of regeneration and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption: And ſeeing that by faith we are the ſonnes of God, if man, without the ſpirit of regeneration,

               <p n="5">V.

               <p n="6">VI. But how abſurd, and how contrary is it to the wiſedome of God, to ſay, that God is prepared to giue greater grace, and the light of his Goſpell, to thoſe who haue well vſed the light of nature?

Experience hath proued this; for when the Goſpell beganne to be publiſhed through the nations, Chriſtian Religion endured no greater enemies then the Philoſophers: Theſe turned the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of their wit to defame the croſſe of Chriſt, and held out to others fierce firebrands to cruelty &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: For the more any one doth affect the praiſe of ciuill vertue, and hath his wit practiſed with much learning, ſo much the more baſe doth the ſimplicity of the Goſpell ſeeme to him, and he is the more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſcandall of the croſſe of Chriſt.</p>

And when the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay that ſufficient grace, which is common to all men, euen to vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men and in fidels, is ſupernaturall, it is a hard thing, that he who is at the firſt touched with this ſupernaturall and helpefull motion, ſhould not feele it: Or if the beginnings of it are doubtfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, at the leſt it muſt needes be felt in progreſſe of time: But neuer any of the heathen hath profeſſed that he hath euer felt this grace, nor is there any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in their wrightings.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Alſo it would be worth the labour to know, by what degrees the heathen man, dwelling in the ſouth countrie, or in the inmoſt part of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> well vſing naturall inſtructions, may at length come to faith in Chriſt: For theſe Sectaries muſt needes faigne many things here, and wantonly play with bold coniectures, and with vnconſtant raſhneſſe: For they muſt faigne that eyther Oracles were pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on that man from heauen; or that Angels were ſent to him; or ſome Prophet, lifted vp by the hayre, hath beene carried thither from ſome other place, that he might inſtruct that man in the Chriſtian faith: For where the Scripture is wanting, audacity muſt needes ſupply the place of the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Finally, what is to be thought of this ſufficient grace, may hence be iudged, in that the <hi>Arminians</hi> themſelues, are not conſtant to themſelues, and they doe ſo build it vp, that they pull it downe: For they which ſay, and doe maintaine with great
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:11390:203"/>force that God doth giue ſufficient grace to all men, doe afterward ſay that God is ready and prepared to giue it to all; as if he indeede were willing to giue it to all, but it was hindred by man that it was not done. Alſo, the ſame men teach, that no man is conuerted without ſpeciall grace, by which ſpeech they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that generall grace is not ſufficient. Finally, when they diuide that grace, into grace which is ſufficient mediately; and grace which is ſufficient immediately, they doe confeſſe that ſome grace is ſufficient medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, which is vnſufficient immediately, and they make many degrees of ſufficient grace, which degrees how many, and what they are, none of them hath explained.</p>

               <p>They maintaine it by that place of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth thus ſpeake of the Gentiles: <hi>That which may be knowne of God, is
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:11390:204"/>manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it vnto them.</hi> Surely here is no mention of ſufficient grace, which the <hi>Arminians</hi> think to be ſupernaturall: For here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the light of nature, and of any ſort of the knowledge of God, by the creatures, which may be had without ſupernaturall grace; by which the Apoſtle doth not ſay, that man hath power of beleeuing in Chriſt, or that he can diſpoſe or prepare himſelfe to regeneration; but he onely ſaith, that the power, and that the deity of God, was ſeene of them by the creation, that they might be inexcuſable. And they are inexcuſable, not becauſe they haue abuſed that grace which was mediately or immediately ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſaluation, but becauſe they haue not vſed the light of nature as farre as they might; and haue endeauoured to choake that light engrafted in them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. They pretend the words of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Chapter</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Gentiles which haue not the law, doe by nature the things contained in the law:</hi> But neither can this place be drawne to ſtabliſh ſufficient grace, which theſe Sectaries will haue to be ſupernaturall: For it ſpeaketh onely of naturall impreſſions of equity and goodneſſe, and of outward actions that are ciuilly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, which are done by the guidance of nature; for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth here make no mention of grace. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, thoſe things contained in the law, may be done by him who doth violate and breake the law: for in the externall worke, he may doe the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the law, and yet not doe them after that manner, and to that end which the law doth require; <hi>that is,</hi> with faith, and to the glory of God.</p>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:11390:204"/>
               <p n="3">III. That which they obiect out of the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Acts, Verſ.</hi> 17. is nothing to the matter, where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth thus ſpeake of the heathen people; <hi>Neuertheleſſe, he left not himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witneſſe:</hi> They doe falſely thinke, that this witneſſe was ſome ſufficient ſauing and ſupernaturall grace, and the law naturally engrauen in their hearts, which ſhould be a Schoole-maſter to Chriſt: For the Apoſtle in the following words, doth explaine what manner of teſtimony this is; ſaying, that God gaue them raine from heauen, and fruitfull ſeaſons, and filled their hearts with foode and gladneſſe; no mention of ſupernaturall grace: And I deny that the law written or printed on the heart, can be a Schoole-maſter to Chriſt, to thoſe who are altogether ignorant of Chriſt; for the law doth not lead vs to a thing vnknown; but after that the grace of Chriſt is offered by the Goſpell, the law, by threats and terrours, doth compell to the embracing of it, that what we cannot attaine to in the law, we might finde in Chriſt: Therefore the morall Law might be to the Iſraelites, a Schoole-maſter to Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt was ſhadowed to them by the ceremoniall law, and was foreſhewed by Propheſies.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And in what ſence that of <hi>Eſay, Chap.</hi> 5.4. <hi>What was more to be done to my vineyard, that I haue not done?</hi> ought to be taken, we haue taught in the thirty ſeauenth <hi>Chapter.</hi> Surely, nothing can be pulled out of this place for ſufficient grace, which is common euen to them to whom the word of God was neuer preached; ſeeing that by this vineyard, the lewes were vnderſtood, to whom the word of God was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the meanes to ſaluation were abundantly
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:11390:205"/>ſupplyed: Nor doth <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeake of the grace which is giuen to particular men, but that which is giuen to a whole Nation, taken together: and that the meanes which <hi>Eſay</hi> doth number vp are externall, and not internall, doth appeare by the ſame place where God is compared to a Vine-dreſſer, which planted a Vineyard in a fruitfull ſoyle, he made a trench about it, he ſet vp a hedge, and built a Wine-preſſe, and a Tower; but he doth not infuſe the groath and vitall iuyce, nor doth ſend the ſunne, and the ſeaſonable raine: God therefore ſaith, that he outwardly ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whatſoeuer things could be adminiſtred to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; for man ought to bring inward diſpoſitions of his owne: Neither is God bound to reſtore to man theſe diſpoſitions which he loſt by his owne fault; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, God in that place ſaith, that <hi>he looked for grapes, and behold wilde grapes:</hi> But this expectation is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God, after the manner of men: God is ſaid to expect ſomething from man, when he doth require ſomething from him; and when he doth deferre the puniſhment, if at any time due fruits are not brought forth, and doth not preſently with the Axe cut vp by the roote the vnfruitfull fig-tree: as Chriſt teacheth, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="5">V. They doe often reckon vp that old and worne out argument: <hi>To him that hath, it ſhall be giuen, Mat.</hi> 25.29. By which words, they ſay, Chriſt doth inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that God will beſtow greater grace vpon him, who hath well vſed the light of nature: Thus they lay the Scripture on a racke, that they may wreſt any thing from it, whereunto it is vnwilling. Chriſt doth there bring the parable of the Talents, and ſaith, that the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:11390:205"/>talent which the wicked ſeruant had hid, was taken from him, and giuen to the ſeruant who had encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Maſters eſtate, by doubling the fiue talents: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to him that hath ſhall be giuen, and he ſhall haue abundance; but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, euen that which he hath.</hi> By the talents, are the gifts of God vnderſtood, and eſpecially the knowledge of God by the Goſpell; which knowledge hee is ſaid to hide, who doth detaine the truth in vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and doth keepe in the knowne truth: This ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent therefore cannot be that ſufficient grace, which doth happen to infidels and vnregenerate perſons; but that grace which God doth beſtow on his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſeruants: Neither by him <hi>that hath,</hi> is vnderſtood a man in his meere naturals, or ſome heathen man furniſhed with ſufficient grace, but a man furniſhed with the knowledge of the Goſpell, which is giuen to one for that end, that by edifying his neighbour he might ſpread the knowledge farre abroad, and like mony put out to vſe, it might be encreaſed with daily additions.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Arnoldus, pag.</hi> 368. hath theſe words; <hi>It is connenient to the iuſtice and goodneſſe of God that he ſhould giue, or be prepared to giue meanes neceſſary to faith, to all them for whom he gaue Chriſt to death, and of whom he requireth faith; ſo that on his part nothing hindreth that all men ſhould not come to faith.</hi> Now wee anſwer, that God doth not require from all men faith on Chriſt, but onely from them to whom the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is preached; and hee is not bound to giue meanes neceſſary to faith, to all them to whom the Goſpell is preached, becauſe man loſt thoſe meanes by his owne
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:11390:206"/>fault: For God requiring of man what he oweth, is not bound to reſtore to man the power of fulfilling that which hee commandeth, ſeeing that man loſt theſe powers by his owne fault. Indeede, the anger of God doth remaine on vnbeleeuers, as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> addeth, but there is no man that would not be incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, if God ſhould change his heart by the ſpirit of regeneration.

               <p>But Sathan being ſhaken off by his labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, deuiſed other practiſes, by which hee doth ſo fight for grace, that he doth ſecretly fight againſt it: For there were not wanting men in diuers places,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:11390:206"/>eſpecially in <hi>Aquitania,</hi> &amp; in the region of <hi>Maſsilia,</hi> who although they profeſſed themſelues to differ from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius,</hi> yet they carped at the writings of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and doe thus inveigh againſt his doctrine of abſolute Election: That by it mens conſciences are made ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, that they might ſleep in vices; by it the raines are loſened to al wickednes; by it men are driuen headlong to deſperation. That Precepts, Exhortations, &amp; threats, are needeleſſe, if the number of the elect be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the purpoſe of God, or if by the immutable decree of God ſome men are elected to faith and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and ſome are appointed to damnation. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, free-will is tyed by the bands of neceſſitie, in as much as they who are ſo elected, cannot but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere. They thought therefore that the middle way betweene <hi>Pelagius</hi> and Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> was to be gone in. For they taught that the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> flowed into his poſteritie: That mans nature was corrupt, and that by the powers of nature he could not come to ſaluation: But they taught that the grace which ſhould cure nature, is preſent with all men; and that all men, either by the naturall law, or by the written law, or by the Goſpell, are ſo called, that it is free for euery man to embrace or refuſe the offered grace, to beleeue, or not to beleeue: For (they ſay) that Chriſt obtained reconciliation for all men; and that God from eternity elected thoſe whom he fore-ſaw would beleeue in Chriſt, and perſeuere in the faith: And therefore that the number of the elect is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the decree of God; but that our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is then certaine, when the courſe of our life is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out.</p>

               <p>Theſe are they who are commonly called <hi>Semipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians:</hi> Differing from <hi>Pelagius</hi> in this, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge nature to be depraued with Originall ſinne, and that they diſtinguiſh nature from grace; but yet by a ſecret agreement, they doe fauour <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius;</hi> becauſe they will haue nature ſo to be a diuerſe thing from grace, that yet they will haue grace equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to extend it ſelfe as farre as nature: Alſo they make ſuch a grace, the vſe whereof doth depend vpon free-will.</p>
               <p>Hee that would throughly know the meaning of theſe men, let him reade the Epiſtle of <hi>Proſper</hi> to Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> inſerted into the Seauenth Tome of the workes of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> moſt worthy to be read with care: For he being a very great admirer of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> and being for this cauſe accuſed by theſe <hi>Semipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,</hi> he requireth the helpe of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and doth deſire to be furniſhed with arguments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee might defend himſelfe againſt them. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there you ſhall plainely know the <hi>Arminian</hi> vaine, and you ſhall ſee <hi>Arminianiſme</hi> graphically and liuely painted out: And but that the title of the Epiſtle, and the Epiſtle it ſelfe, did teſtifie, both the Author and the age, you would ſweare, it were the Epiſtle of one, who being prouoked by the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and being ill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, doth implore the helpe of one more learned. That now it cannot be a doubt, out of what puddles they haue drawne their opinions, and which of the ancient Heretiques they haue propounded to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to imitate; I ſhall not much ſtay the haſtening Reader if I lay downe the words of the <hi>Semipelagians</hi> themſelues, as they are recited by <hi>Proſper</hi> himſelfe.
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:11390:207"/>
                  <hi>This is</hi> (ſaith Proſper) <hi>their declaration and profeſsion, that euery man ſinned when</hi> Adam <hi>ſinned, and that no man is ſaued, in regeneration, by his owne workes, but by the grace of God, and yet that the propitiation which is in the Sacrament of the bloud of Chriſt, is propounded to all men without exception, that whoſoeuer will come to faith and baptiſme may be ſaued: And that God fore-knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making of the world, who were to beleeue, and who would continue in that faith, which afterwards ſhould be helped by the grace of God: And that hee Predeſtinated thoſe to his kingdome, whom he hauing freely called, he fore-ſaw would be worthy of Election, and would depart out of this life with a good end: And therefore that euery man is admoniſhed by the ordinances of God to beleeue, &amp; to worke that no man might deſpaire of obtaining eternall life; ſeeing that the reward is prepared for voluntary deuotion. But this purpoſe of the calling of God by which the difference of them that are to be elected, and of them that are to be reiected, is ſaid to haue beene made, eyther before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, or in the very creation of mankinde, that according to the pleaſure of the creator, ſome ſhould be created veſſels of honour, others veſſels of diſhonour, this</hi> (they ſay) <hi>doth both take away from them that are fallen the care of riſing againe, and alſo doth yeeld occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſluggiſh drowſineſſe to the Saints, becauſe on eyther ſide labour is ſuperfluous, if neither he that is reiected, can by any induſtry and diligence enter, nor he that is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted can by any negligence fall away: For after whatſoeuer manner they ſhall behaue themſelues, nothing can happen to them, but what God hath determined; and vnder an vncertaine hope, the courſe cannot be constant, ſeeing that the intention of him that doth endeauour, is vaine, if
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:11390:208"/>the Election of him that predeſtinateth hath appointed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: Therefore all induſtry is remoued, and all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are taken away, if the appointment of God doe preuent the will of man; and a kinde of fatall neceſsitie is brought in, vnder this name of predeſtination.</hi> Theſe were the words of the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> altogether like <hi>Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> and of the ſame ſtampe.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe things alſo which follow be pondered and conſidered of: <hi>They determine, that to this gift of ſaluation, all men vniuerſally are called, either by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall law, or by the written law, or by the preaching of the Goſpell, that both they that will, might be made the ſonnes of God, and that they might be inexcuſable, who will not be faithfull; becauſe herein is the iuſtice of God, that they who will not beleeue ſhould periſh; and his goodneſſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth herein, that he will put backe no man from life, but indifferently would all men to be ſaued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth: And that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt dyed for all mankinde; and that no man at all is excepted from the redemption of his bloud, although he paſſe through his whole life in a farre other opinion.</hi> And a little after; <hi>They doe not conſent, that the predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted number of the elect, can neither be encreaſed nor diminiſhed, leaſt the incitations of them that exhort men, ſhould haue no place with infidels, and thoſe that neglect predeſtination, &amp;c. They haue receiued the election of God, according to fore-knowledge,</hi> to wit, <hi>that therefore God hath made ſome men veſſels of honour, and ſome veſſels of diſhonour, becauſe he fore-ſaw the faith of euery one.</hi> Truely this is meere <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> but that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> doe clothe their opinions more gloriouſly, and doe paint them with exquiſite colours, and doe
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:11390:208"/>more ſparingly vſe the word Merit, which not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> writers (but in another ſence then the Papiſts at this day doe) did often vſe. Finally they doe, as they doe who ſet before their gueſts old and reiected dainties, by putting to them new ſauce.</p>
               <p>To this Epiſtle is added another of the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of <hi>Hilareus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Areles,</hi> to Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> where he doth attribute theſe things to the <hi>Semip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This fore-knowledge they thus vnderſtand,</hi> to wit, <hi>that men are ſaid to be fore-knowne for faith which is to follow, and that ſuch a perſeuerance is giuen to no man, from which hee is not ſuffered to ſwerue, but that he may fall from it, and be weakened by his owne will. Whatſoeuer is giuen to thoſe that are predeſtinated, they contend, that they may looſe it, or keepe it, according to their owne will. Which then were falſe if they did thinke it true that ſome men haue beene made partakers of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance that they could not but perſeuere: Thence it is that they will not admit of this, that they ſhould allow, that the number of them that are predeſtinated, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that are reiected is determined.</hi> Theſe are they whoſe authority was more to <hi>Arminius,</hi> then the authority of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> yea, then of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe: For they haue liberally and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borrowed all their opinions from the <hi>Semipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And they doe plainely deny, that actuall faith, and the act of beleeuing is the gift of God: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they doe ſometimes make ſhew of this, and doe thunder out with full mouthes that faith is from God; yet in the whole thred of their diſputation, they doe openly bewray that they are verry farre from that opinion: For they deny that faith is iufuſed by God into the hearts of men, but that God doth giue power and faculty of beleeuing; Nor doth God other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe giue the act of beleeuing, then as the minde is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with knowledge, and the affections being ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, doe put forward the will, which is not to giue faith, but to incite to faith: Yea, by their opinion, it is certaine that God doth not giue the power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in Chriſt, but doth onely enlighten the minde that it may know Chriſt, and allure the appetites with a gentle perſwaſion: For hee that doth onely ſhew the light, and exhort the traueller to goe, doth
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:11390:211"/>not giue him power of going. Theſe are the words of the <hi>Arminian</hi> conferrers at the <hi>Hage, p.</hi> 275. <hi>We deny that faith is the gift of God, in reſpect of the actuall infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it into our hearts, but it is ſo called in reſpect of the power of comming to it.</hi> This indeede is to vſe no circumſtance, but to ſpeake it plainely enough. For, they ſay that God doth not infuſe faith into our hearts, but that he doth giue the meanes to come to faith, which meanes we may vſe, if we will, for this is in the power of free-will.</p>
               <p>The ſame men, <hi>pag.</hi> 306. doe profeſſe that they beleeue that the very act of beleeuing is from God, and yet a little after they doe retract what they had granted; for they doe ouerthrow all thoſe places of Scripture, by which wee endeauour to proue that faith, and the act of beleeuing, is from God. The men of our party, did proue this by the words of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.65. <hi>No man can come to me, vnleſſe it be giuen him by the father.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> anſwere, that that place of <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſpeaketh of nothing but of that faculty whereby one may beleeue, and therefore it doth not make to the purpoſe, in as much as it is to be proued that the very act of beleeuing is the gift of God. Would they haue it to be proued by vs, and to be euinced by argument, if they did beleeue it, and did ſeriouſly profeſſe it? Surely, that their confeſſion was diſſembled, and therefore a little after they doe alter and reuoke it: In the ſame place they doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly corrupt that famous place of S. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>By grace ye are ſaued through faith, and that not of your ſelues, it is the gift of God.</hi> In which place both ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and faith, are called the gift of God. For they
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:11390:211"/>deny that faith is there called the gift of God, but ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. O your fidelity ye Sectaries! What doth this concerne you, or why doe youſo much feare leſt faith ſhould be called by the Apoſtle the gift of God? This indeed is a very great malignity, and an open confeſſion, whereby they diſcloſe that they thinke that faith is not the gift of God. With a like licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doe they ſport themſelues, in deprauing the words of the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy, Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>If God will giue them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth.</hi> The men of our party brought this place, that they might proue conuerſion and the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to be from God: But theſe Sectaries, as it were in a mockery doe reiect this place, as that which ſpeaketh of repentance, as of a thing that is vncertaine, and which may happen: Doubtleſſe it doth not pleaſe the <hi>Arminians,</hi> that the act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion is the gift of God. And although they ſay in ambiguous and deceiptfull words, that repentance is the gift of God, yet they thinke that it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by no place of Scripture; when yet the Scripture ſaith: <hi>It is God which doth worke in vs effectually to will and to doe. Philip.</hi> 2. And that <hi>It is giuen to vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt. Phil.</hi> 1. Surely theſe words, to will, to doe, and to beleeue, doe note out the very act of willing and beleeuing, and not the power whereby we may be willing or not be willing, beleeue or not beleeue.</p>
               <p>But they doe in no other thing more open their meaning, then while they deny that faith is infuſed into our hearts by God, but that onely men are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to faith, and allured with a gentle perſwaſion
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:11390:212"/>and invitation, which they call morall and reſiſtible; after the ſame manner that a boy is drawne by an Apple offred him, or a hog by bran laid before him. If this be true, and if the efficacy of the holy-Spirit doth no otherwiſe imprint faith then by perſwading, it is plaine that faith is not the gift of God: For hee that perſwadeth to beleeue, doth not giue faith, but doth perſwade. <hi>Arminius</hi> againſt <hi>Perkins, pag.</hi> 57. hath theſe words: <hi>That faith and repentance cannot be had but by the gift of God, is moſt plaine in the Scriptures. But the ſame Scripture, and the nature of the gift of eyther of them, doth moſt cleerely teach, that that gift is giuen by the manner of perſwaſion.</hi> Theſe are things that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together, for nothing is giuen by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſwaſion: He that ſtirreth mee vp to run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, doth thereby neither giue mee the running it ſelfe, nor the power of running. The ſame man, <hi>pag.</hi> 211. ſaith, <hi>God hath determined to ſaue them that beleeue by his grace,</hi> that is, <hi>by a milde and ſweete perſwaſion, conuenient and agreeable to their free-will, not by an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent action or motion, which they neither will nor can reſiſt, nor can be willing to reſiſt.

               <p>And although they thinke that there is no grace of God, which may not be reſiſted by man, yet they confeſſe, that God doth ſo certainely call ſome men, that they muſt infallibly follow; <hi>to wit,</hi> them whom he doth call in ſuch a congruent and agreeable time and manner, and with ſuch efficacy and meaſure of light, that they are moſt certainely conuerted. <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> againſt <hi>Perkins, pag.</hi> 67. doth ſay, that the inward perſwaſion of the holy Ghoſt is in all them, to whom the word is preached: And that this perſwaſion is two-fold, one ſufficient, the other effectuall; as if that perſwaſion could be ſufficient, which is not of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent efficacy. Hee proceedes: <hi>Sufficient perſwaſion is that, whereby a man may will, and beleeue, and be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when it is vſed; effectuall perſwaſion is that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he to whom it is applied doth will, doth beleeue, and is conuerted:</hi> For he thinketh, that he in whom the ſpirit of God doth not worke effectually, may yet beleeue and conuert himſelfe, although hee neuer be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He addeth; <hi>The firſt of theſe perſwaſions is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the decree of prouidence, with a certaine and ſure
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:11390:213"/>fore-knowledge, that it ſhall be reiected by the free-will of man: The other is adminiſtred by the decree of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with a certaine and ſure fore-knowledge, that he to whom it is applied, ſhall both will, and belecue, and be conuerted; becauſe it is ſo applyed, according as God knoweth it to be congruent and agreeable, for the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the conuerſion of him, on whom it is beſtowed.</hi> He hath the ſame words, <hi>pag.</hi> 245. As alſo <hi>Arnoldus</hi> againſt <hi>Tilenus, pag.</hi> 79. Finally, it is familiar to the <hi>Arminians</hi> to teach, that ſome men are called by God, after an incongruent manner, whereby they that are called doe neuer follow, although they are able to follow; and that ſome are called in a congruent manner and time, wherein they that are called doe certainely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and that by the decree of predeſtination, which cannot be deceiued.

               <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> at the <hi>Hage,</hi> in the defence of their fourth Article, doe faſten theſe things vpon vs; <hi>That God is willing to ſaue ſome men, whether their free-will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or not aſſent thereto.</hi> This is a foule calumny: For whoſoeuer God doth ſaue, hee bendeth his will, that he might worke of his owne accord, and might obey God. The ſame men, <hi>pag.</hi> 268. doe ſo deale with vs, as if we taught, that faith is wrought in vs by God without vs, and as if wee taught that our wils were compelled, and wee drawne in our conuerſion, as blockes. Theſe things (according to their cuſtome) they attribute to vs, and that liberally enough: They change the gennine and proper ſtate of the queſtion, becauſe they know that our opinion cannot be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, vnleſſe it be firſt changed.</p>
               <p>Thus therefore we determine: That the election of God is immutable, and thoſe that are written in the booke of life, cannot be put out, nor the decrees of God be broken: Wherefore, whoſoeuer God hath elected to ſaluation, hee hath neceſſarily elected to
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:11390:214"/>faith and repentance; in as much as without theſe there is no ſaluation. Whence it commeth to paſſe, that it is impoſſible but that the elect ſhould obtaine faith, and be conuerted; which thing, ſeeing it is done in ſome ſooner, and in ſome later, and that the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are called into the Lords Vine-yard at diuers houres of the day; yet it is certaine, that he was not elected, who hath not at the leaſt beleeued in Chriſt, in the time of death. This is to vs the ground &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of truth, which can be ouerwhelmed by no Art, nor ſhaken with any force. Whoſoeuer are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the purpoſe of God, doe neceſſarily follow, leaſt God ſhould faile of his purpoſe: <hi>And whoſoeuer God hath predeſtinated, them he called, and whom he called, he iuſtified, and whom he iuſtified, he glorified, Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>If therefore it muſt needes be, that all they that are elected, muſt come to faith in Chriſt; the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this certainty, is not mans free-will, but the will of God. For an immutable, and an eternall thing, cannot reſt on a flitting and vnſtable foundation. Yet we doe not ſay, that man is drawne of God, by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible force; For that is an vnreſiſtible force, which though you would reſiſt, you cannot: For how can we be drawne by the vnreſiſtible grace of God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this very thing, that wee will not reſiſt, but yeelde obedience to him of our owne accord, is the grace of God it ſelfe? So when all of vs deſire to be happy freely, and yet neceſſarily, there is no man but he that is mad, will ſay that we are compelled to it by any vnreſiſtible force: we doe not ſay that the elect, although they would reſiſt the calling of God,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:11390:214"/>yet could not: but we ſay, that the elect doe at length certainely and infallibly, and of their owne accord, follow God calling, that the Election of God might be fulfilled: For this is the ſtate of the queſtion; <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may come to paſſe, that he who is elected, may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be conuerted, and may euen to the very end, reſiſt God calling, or may ſo reſiſt the grace of God, that he may finally fall from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is there any neede, here carefully to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, whether he that is elected can reſiſt grace, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he cannot reſiſt grace, and whether hee is vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to that which hee willeth. Wee haue no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be ſo acute: For it ſufficeth to the defence of the certainty of election, to determine that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that he who is elected ſhould not be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſhould finally reſiſt. If we get this granted, we will eaſily ſuffer the <hi>Arminians</hi> to skirmiſh and flouriſh at leaſure, and to diſpute whether that may be done, that neuer hath beene done, nor neuer ſhall be done; and whether the tormentours could breake the thighes of our Sauiour, which were impoſſible to be broken, becauſe the decree of God did hinder. Theſe are the wranglings of idle men, who make worke for themſelues, that they might procure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation and trouble to others. The wils of men are after a maruailous &amp; ſecret manner ſo turned by God, that it is impoſſible that man ſhould will to doe thoſe things, to the doing whereof their naturall powers haue ability; and although man may naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, yet it is impoſſible that hee ſhould will to reſiſt finally: And thoſe things may certainely and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably happen, which are done by men willing and
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:11390:215"/>witting, and hauing naturally power of reſiſting. We doe not therefore deſpute of the powers of reſiſting grace, which wee finde by experience, to our owne loſſe, to be in the godly and faithfull: But we diſpute of the impoſſibility of the euent, and we earneſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that it cannot be, that he who is elected, ſhould finally reſiſt, and by his incredulity ſtriue againſt God to the end of his life.</p>
               <p>And that thoſe things which are done by men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly without conſtraint, without naturall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and without the impulſion of any externall cauſe forcing mans free-will, doe happen neceſſarily, and the prouidence of God ſo decreeing, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth affirme, and experience doth witneſſe: For the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe acknowledge, that the death of Chriſt was decreed by God, and that it could not be but the decree of God muſt be fulfilled; when yet that death hapned by the wickedneſſe of the Iewes, who were led to this naughty act of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. <hi>Prou.</hi> 21. God doth turne the hearts of Kings, and doth leade them whither hee will; euen as the conueyer doth guide the riuer, whether he pleaſeth. God without conſtraint, did ſuddenly change the minde of <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 33. and of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.23. and of the Aegyptians, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.25. Which although they came to paſſe vnauoydably, yet they were done of their owne accord, and not by an vnreſiſtible force, but the liberty of mans free-will remaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht. And if this be true in wicked men, how much more in good and faithfull men? Are they drawne vnwillingly, to whom God doth giue a heart of fleſh, for a ſtony heart? Or thoſe to whom God promiſeth
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:11390:215"/>that he will cauſe that they ſhall walke in his wayes? <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.37.</p>
               <p>And we would eaſily admit of the words <hi>reſiſtibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> and <hi>vnreſiſtibilitie,</hi> although they are rode and vnhandſome, if they were not wreſted otherwiſe then to that which they ſignifie: For they call that reſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which may be hindred, auerted, and ouercome; when yet it is one thing to reſiſt, and another thing to ouercome. Vnreſiſtible force is that which cannot be oppugned nor reſiſted, and not that which cannot be ouercome; reſiſtance noteth out the fight, not the victorie: For no man (as I know of) hath euer deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the efficacy of the ſpirit may be reſiſted by man: Nor is there any one, in whoſe minde piety is ſo deepely ſeated, who doth not feele an inward wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and is often deſtracted with contrary deſires: But that he that is elected, may ſo reſiſt grace, that he may neuer admit it, or being once admitted, hee may altogether and finally ſhake it off; there can nothing more be done to aboliſh the decrees of God: for wee doe not place the inuincible power of that faith which God doth giue to his elect, in the decree of faith, and in the perfection and ſtrength of that vertue; but in the certaine and ſure helpe of God, which hee doth ſupply to his elect, according to his purpoſe: For there is no faith ſo well growne, or ſo well ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which would not faile, if God ſhall neuer ſo little withdraw his aide; euen as the child of two years old, at the firſt taking of his ſteps, is held vp by the hand of his father; although the childe be fearefull, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely he ſhall not fall, becauſe his father doth ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold him vp. And if God doth ſometimes ſuffer
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:11390:216"/>his elect to ſtumble and fall, he doth forthwith raiſe them vp: Whence it comes to paſſe, that they are made more wary, and doe more acknowledge the care of God ouer them, and by their very fall, doe gather ſtrength; euen as when the parts of a broken bone doe ſo grow together againe, and are couered with a hard skin, that that part which was broken, is growne ſtronger then it was before. Alſo if our faith be weake, but yet ſerious and wreſtling with doubtings, our bountifull father doth helpe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and doth not breake the bruiſed reede. For as they that were bleare eyed, and blinde of one eye, beholding the braſen Serpent, were no leſſe healed, then they that had both their eyes, and did ſee cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe they were not healed by the power of their ſeeing faculty, nor by the cleareneſſe of their eyes, but by the diuine power which God did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe by this image of the Serpent: So wee are not ſaued by the merit of the perfection of our faith, but by the bounty of God in Chriſt our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>But what and how great that ſoule bending and perſwading power of the holy Ghoſt, working in the hearts of the elect is, and by what meanes, occaſions, and degrees hee doth further his worke, they themſelues cannot expreſſe who doe feele it: Euen as the Woman with childe, doth not know after what manner the liuing fruite is formed and doth encreaſe: But that the power of the holy Ghoſt is very great, the Scripture doth witneſſe, as hereafter ſhall be proued.</p>
               <p>But how great ſoeuer this efficacy is, yet God
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:11390:216"/>doth not draw vs as logs, but as men. He doth draw vs being vnwilling, that wee might be willing; hee doth follow vs being willing, that we might not will in vaine: And when, of being vnwilling, hee doth make vs willing, he doth not onely not take away the liberty of the will, but he alſo reſtoreth it, becauſe to ſerue God willingly and with ioy, is liberty. And he doth ſo further the increaſes of faith and regeneration, that for the moſt part we doe not perceiue that wee doe grow, but after ſome ſpace of time, we know that we haue growne: Euen as wee doe not ſee plants as they grow, but wee ſee they haue growne. The word of the Goſpell receiued into the eare, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the heart, is the ordinary manner whereby God doth affect mens hearts, and doth beginne, and further regeneration, hee inſpiring into it hidden po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers towards them whom he decreed to ſaue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the incorruptible ſeed, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.

The ſparkes of which new life, fallen from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into our hearts, the Spirit of God doth ſtirre vp, and further as it were with bellows, &amp; doth draw out groanes that cannot be vttered, ſtriking, &amp; wounding the heart with ſecret pricks, enlightning the minde, gouerning the appetites, bending the will, which (whether <hi>Arminius</hi> will or no) muſt alſo be framed

               <p>And that the will is rather the ſeate of vertues, then the ſenſitiue appetites, reaſon it ſelfe doth proue: For it is more like that the reaſonable appetite, which is peculiar to man, is adorned with vertues, rather then the appetite which is common to vs with beaſts, which if it were the ſeate of the vertues, of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, holineſſe, and charity, the ſenſitiue faculty ceaſing after death vertue alſo would ceaſe, and the will of the ſeparated ſoule, would be altogether voide of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe: And if any one doth ſuppoſe that the appetites may be called iuſt ſubiectiuely, and that they are the ſubiect of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:11390:217"/>and holineſſe, becauſe they obey the minde enlightned by God, there is no cauſe why the will, freely ſubiecting it ſelfe to that perſwaſion, ought not alſo after the ſame manner, be called iuſt and holy, and the ſubiect of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe. And ſeeing that the rectified will of a wiſe and pious man is wont to rule ouer the affections, and to compell them into the compaſſe; who doth not ſee, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is rather in that part, which being rectified, doth rule ouer the affections, then in the affections, which doe for the moſt part ſlackly obey this holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? I confeſſe indeed that Chriſtian vertues doe in ſome part pertaine to the ſenſitiue appetities; But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner that the art of training vp a horſe, which doth properly reſide in the horſe-man, doth in ſome part belong to the horſe, whom the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the rider hath broake to the circuits and compaſſe, and hath taught to moue himſelfe with an ordered motion. Could there be none more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious meanes inuented of maintaining the liberty of the will of man, then by depriuing it of all vertue? Surely the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſhew themſelues ſtout patrons of the liberty of free-will, if they ſpoyle the will of vertues, that it might be free, and doe ſhake off the bonds of holy habits from the will, leſt it ſhould be too much bound. For as they teach that the will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, was not indued with ſpirituall gifts, leſt it ſhould be thought by the fall to be defiled with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and leſt contrary vices, and a natural deprauation ſhould be thought to haue ſucceded in the place of thoſe ſpirituall gifts which were loſt: So they alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the habits of faith and charity, &amp;c. are infuſed
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:11390:218"/>into the will by God, leſt the will being changed by that infuſion ſhould loſe the power of finally reſiſting the holy-Ghoſt. For they thinke that iniury is done to the will, if the liberty of caſting it ſelfe headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell be taken away, which ſurely is an vnhappy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and for the defence whereof theſe Sectaries ought not to apply themſelues with all their ſtrength, as if it ſtood vs ſo much vpon ſo to be free that wee might reſiſt God to the end, and deſtroy our ſelues: Neither was this a fit cauſe of making the will ſuch a ſilly and ſingle thing, naturally indued neither with vices nor vertues, but a thing that may be turned and winded euery way, and like the prime and firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, capable of euery impreſſion; ſeeing that on the contrary, the will of man is naturally euill, and euen incorporated in vices, as we haue abundantly proued, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. and men according to their will, eſpecially, are eyther good or euill.</p>
               <p>We determine therefore, that Chriſtian vertues are not obtained by vſe and induſtry, but are infuſed by God into the minde, and into the will; who doth not onely giue power of beleeuing, but alſo to beleeue in Chriſt it ſelfe, and doth worke in vs actuall faith: As he who by his certaine and abſolute purpoſe hath decreed to giue faith to them whom hee decreed to ſaue, whereby they might be ſaued: The effect of which grace we determine doth not depend on mans free-will, and that it is not in our power to beleeue, and to be conuerted if we will, ſeeing that on the contrary God giueth to the elect, that they might will to be conuerted, &amp; to beleeue, giuing them both to will, and to doe, according to his good pleaſure.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Arminians</hi> determine that the efficacy of the ſpirit of God, working in our hearts, is in a morall perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: For they deny that thoſe habits of Faith, Hope and Charity, are infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into mens hearts by God, leſt the liberty of free-will ſhould be violated, and leſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion ſhould be made by an vnreſiſtible and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoidable neceſſity, but rather by a gentle invitation, which man may eyther reſiſt or obey.</p>
               <p>This their opinion doth reſt on this falſe principle, that there is no perſwaſion which may not be ſo reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted that the effect thereof may at length be hindred. We contend, that this principle is falſe: For there is a perſwaſion ſo effectuall that it doth neceſſarily draw a man to aſcent; which although thou maiſt reſiſt, if thou wouldſt, yet thou canſt not be willing. If one, in a ſcorching drought, ſhould offer ſweete &amp; whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome drinke to him that is a thirſt, and ſhould, with a friendly perſwaſion invite him to drinke, and ſhould diſſwade and hinder nothing on the contrary, I ſay that it cannot be, but that hee who is thirſty ſhould take the drinke offered him. A man hath fallen into the hands of enemies, who loade him with chaines, and caſt him into priſon, and bring him neere the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: Now, if one ſhould enter the ſame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who ſhould looſen the chaines, open the gate,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:11390:219"/>and ſhew him a ſure way of eſcape, and ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him that he ſhould flie, and free himſelfe from the preſent danger, I doe not thinke that ſuch a man could obtain of himſelfe, that he ſhould not obey ſuch perſwaſion: And if in humane things there are many ſuch like perſwaſions, which you cannot be willing to reſiſt: How much leſſe can that perſwaſion be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, when to the euidence and certainty of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and to the excellency of thoſe heauenly good things which the Goſpell doth offer to vs, and to the knowledge of the preſent danger, the diuine power hath alſo come, and that heart-turning might of the holy-Ghoſt, whoſe efficacy cannot be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Surely there is a certaine perſwaſiue neceſſity, and a perſwaſion more mighty then any command, which doth ſo bend thoſe that are willing, that they would rather endure any thing then not to will what they deſire.</p>
               <p>Reaſon it ſelfe doth adde credit to theſe things, and the nature of mans will, in which it is engrafted to moue it ſelfe to the preſcript and perſwaſion of the minde, vnleſſe when the indocible affections doe reſiſt reaſon. But as often as reaſon doth conſpire and agree with the affections, it is impoſſible but the will ſhould moue it ſelfe thither whether the minde doth perſwade it, and the appetites doe incite it; for what ſhould call it away, ſeeing it can be moued with no other impulſion?</p>
               <p>Nor is it any doubt that God, who doth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know our ſoules, and the moſt fit occaſions by which the ſoule being apprehended cannot reſiſt him calling, and doth know in what part it is more flexible;
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:11390:219"/>ſhould not be able ſo to enlighten the minde, and imprint on the fancy (which hath the naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ouer the appetites) ſo cleere an image, ſo terrifie the conſcience, by the propounding of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo ſtirre it vp, by laying before it the eternall rewards, ſo gently inuite, and ſo fitly perſwade, that preſently all reſiſtance ſhould ceaſe, and all contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Arnoldus</hi> againſt <hi>Tilenus, pag.</hi> 251. ſpake inconſiderately, when hee ſaid that the liberty of the will conſiſted in this, that all things which are required to an action being granted, and being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the will might ſuſpend and ſtoppe the action. He ought to haue ſaid, that the liberty of the will conſiſteth in this, that it doth with a free and ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneus motion, apply it ſelfe to thoſe things which the vnderſtanding and the appetites doe perſwade, or if the appetites doe diſagree with reaſon, and diuers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects are propounded, that the will may, by a free ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, moue it ſelfe to what part it will. Let the ſoules which doe enioy the ſight of God in heauen be for an example; to whom all things are fully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, which are required to ſtirre vp the will to loue God, yet their will cannot ſuſpend that action, nor forbid and auert that act of loue, wherewith they loue God: Neither can it be ſaid (although it maketh little to the preſent matter) that the cauſe why they cannot hate God is, becauſe occaſions of hatred, and incitations to ſinne are wanting: For the Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall had no greater occaſion. The ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſinning which ouerthrew the Angels, were neuer wanting. The too much admiration, and
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:11390:220"/>too great loue of themſelues, and by it a more ſlacke contemplation, and a more backward loue of God, carried thoſe moſt excellent creatures headlong, and ſtirred them vp to rebellion.</p>
               <p>The will indeede is affected to two or more things, and betweene two propounded obiects doth freely chooſe, vnleſſe when the laſt and beſt end is deſired: But it doth often ſo ſtrongly apply it ſelfe to ſome one thing, that it cannot reſiſt it ſelfe. And if the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the holy-Ghoſt, turning the heart, working in the elect, ſhal alſo come to it, which doth ſo draw &amp; gouern the raines of the affections, that it may bend and turne the will following of its owne accord; what meruaile is it, if ſuch a rider cannot be finally ſhaken off, although the appetites doe ſo much reſiſt, and doe hardly giue ouer that rule and command which beſides right and equity they haue ceaſed on?</p>
               <p>All theſe theſe things pertaine thither, that we may teach, that the euent of conuerſion is not thereby vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, or (as theſe innouators ſpeake) reſiſtible, although God ſhould moue the heart by a morall perſwaſion, and ſhould allure the will by a congruent and meete invitation.</p>
               <p>But yet whoſoeuer ſhall heare the Scripture, or ſhall deſcend to examples and to experience, ſhall finde that the efficacy of the holy-Ghoſt, working in mens hearts, ought not to be reſtrained to morall perſwaſion: For it is a hard thing to conceiue in ones minde, what perſwaſion God vſed in the conuerſion of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was caſt downe, as it were with lightning, and whoſe ſtubbornneſſe kicking againſt the pricks was broken.</p>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:11390:220"/>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the Theefe, into whom in the midſt of torments, and in the very agony of death, God did infuſe faith after an vnvtterable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: For what? Doe theſe Sectaries thinke, that he obtained faith by vſe, and by the frequent actions of pietie? Surely that cannot be ſaid, ſeeing that in one moment he came from the height of incredulitie, and from moſt deſperately wicked manners, to a moſt ſtrong faith. Was he inuited by a gentle perſwaſion? No ſurely: For whatſoeuer things were preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, were ſo many diſſwaſions, and they ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, that the faith of the Apoſtles themſelues did then faile: The very torments which the miſerable man did then ſuffer could eaſily haue taken away the ſenſe of that allurement and perſwaſion, vnleſſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret power of the ſpirit of Chriſt had broken through all obſtacles.</p>
               <p>Would the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 1.19.20. and <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.12. ſay, that that power of God, whereby he doth effectually worke in the hearts of beleeuers, is the ſame with that whereby hee raiſed Chriſt from the dead, if hee ſhould onely conuert mens hearts by a morall perſwaſion, and by a gentle invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> being fully determined to kill <hi>Dauid,</hi> came to <hi>Naioth,</hi> whither <hi>Dauid</hi> was fled, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. but as ſoone as he came thither, vnmindfull of <hi>Dauid,</hi> he is catched with a propheticall inſpiration: Where is there here any morall perſwaſion or invitation? If therefore God changeth the mindes of wicked men, without any morall perſwaſion, why ſhall hee not exerciſe the ſame power towards his elect.</p>
               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:11390:221"/>
               <p>And I doe not ſee how thoſe ſpeeches, of creating a new heart, of raiſing man from the dead, and of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing new life, by which the Scripture doth expreſſe our conuerſion, may be applyed to note out morall perſwaſion. The new man is not created by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, but by the infuſion of new life; and it muſt needes be, that ſome ſupernaturall thing muſt come, which cannot be explained by man.</p>
               <p>And if God ſhould allure men to beleeue by a meere perſwaſion and invitation, God ſhould not be the efficient cauſe of faith: For hee that doth onely exhort and perſwade that we may beleeue, doth not giue beleeuing it ſelfe; no, nor he who doth ſuggeſt the powers of beleeuing, as we haue ſaid before; but hee doth moue metaphorically and intentionally, as wee are moued by Obiects, and by a knowne end.</p>
               <p>And that here is ſomething elſe beſide perſwaſion, may hence be gathered, in that you ſee ſome men are vehemently ſet on fire by a ſmall perſwaſion, ſome on the other ſide, who know the truth, are yet in the midſt of ſome euident and moſt certaine perſwaſions cold, and not at all affected. Former times, and our owne age, hath brought forth many Martyrs, who haue beene vnlearned, and but lightly inſtructed in the doctrine of the Goſpell; but that ſtrong natured and laborious <hi>Origen,</hi> who had the Scripture at his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends, being vnable to endure Martyrdome, choſe rather to burne incenſe to the Diuell. Many among miracles, and in the midſt of the light of the Goſpell, are incredulous, as the men of Capernaum; or elſe are giuen to their belly and gluttony, as daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Neither doth this therefore come to paſſe, becauſe ſome of the vnregenerate are more capable of morall perſwaſion then others, ſeeing all men are altogether auerſe from God, and dead in ſinnes: Alſo you may ſee the moſt wicked men and worſt affected, to be conuerted to the faith of Chriſt, as the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> &amp;c. that God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, and where ſin hath abounded, there grace hath abounded. On the other ſide, you may ſee many not ſo euilly diſpoſed, as the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> that are not called by the preaching of the Goſpell, then which, there is no other perſwaſion more wholeſome. There are ſome ages, in which the gate of the Church is wide open, and there is a great concourſe of people in it, as the Apoſtle teacheth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. <hi>A great doore and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, is opened to me.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>When I came to Troas to preach the Goſpell, a doore was opened to me of the Lord.</hi> On the contrary, there are ſome times, in which the paſſage to the Church is as it were ſtopped vp, and the efficacy of the Goſpell doth ſeeme to be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when the Paſtors of the Church doe finde much ſtubborneneſſe in the people, &amp; a brawnie skin drawn ouer their conſciences, the hardneſſe whereof doth turne and blunt the edge of preaching. This doth not happen, becauſe in ſome ages men are borne bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or becauſe God doth vſe other meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the teaching of them, then of others; but becauſe it ſeemed good to God to ſoften the hearts of theſe, and to reueale to them his arme and his power of ſaluation, and to faſten the ſword of the word of God with greater force into their mindes, and

               <p n="3">III. Agreeable to theſe things are the words of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>As many as are led by the ſpirit of God, are the ſonnes of God.</hi> Here I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether it is poſſible that he who is the ſonne of God, ſhould be made the ſonne of the diuell? If there is any modeſty left in them, they dare not ſay this openly, although it doth plainely enough follow from their opinion, by which they determine, that the elect may be reprobated. This therefore being laid downe, that the ſonnes of God cannot be made the ſonnes of the diuell; I demand, whence is this impoſſibilitie of falling away, and why cannot hee who is led by the ſpirit of God, which is called the ſpirit of adoption, be made the childe of the diuell? The cauſe of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility muſt either be the election of God, or mans free-will; but not mans free-will, as we haue at large proued; therefore it is the election of God, by which it commeth to paſſe, that it is an impoſſible thing that the faith of the elect ſhould be finally loſt and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And with what great efficacie God doth worke in mens hearts, the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. where hee wiſheth that it were made knowne to the <hi>Epheſians, What is the exceeding greatneſſe of his power to vs ward, who beleeue, according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> The Apoſtle doth purpoſely heape vp emphaticall and ſignificant words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might declare that power and effectual ſtrength, farre differing from the phraſe of <hi>Arminius,</hi> in whoſe writings, theſe ſpeeches are often found; <hi>that God
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:11390:223"/>will not vſe his omnipotency to the conuerſion of man, but a gentle invitation, which is agreeable to free-will.</hi> And leaſt any one ſhould ſeeke a refuge in the word <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> reſtraining this power to an effectuall perſwaſion; the ſame Apoſtle doth in the ſame Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teach, that this power is the ſame with that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he raiſed Chriſt from the dead, where perſwaſion hath no place: for he preſently addeth; <hi>according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> So <hi>Coloſ</hi> 2.12. ſpeaking of our regeneration by faith; <hi>With Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye are riſen, by the faith of the operation of God, who raiſed him from the dead;</hi> Inſinuating, that the reſurrection of Chriſt, and our regeneration were wrought by the ſame force and power.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The ſame Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. doth pray that God <hi>would fulfill the worke of faith, with power,</hi> in the <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Agreeable to this is that of Chriſt,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:11390:224"/>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 11.22. where he doth deſcribe, in theſe words, the caſting out of Sathan obtaining the rule in man, and the greater power of the ſpirit of God thruſting him out: <hi>When a strong man armed keepeth his pallace, his goods are in peace; but when a ſtronger then he ſhall come vpon him and ouercome him, he taketh from him all his armour, wherein hee truſted, and diuideth his ſpoiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Theſe Sectaries here doe alleadge and faine many things: Firſt, they ſay that this power, how great ſoeuer it is, is reſiſtible, neither doe we deny it; but the queſtion is, whether it may finally be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: For it is not likely, that God will exerciſe that mighty power and efficacy towards that man whom he will ſaue, that he might be ouercome by man, and that man at length might be more powerfull then God: Yea truely, in that very place of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. where hee doth extoll that power with a goodly ſpeech, he maketh mention of the reſiſtance which doth riſe againſt the knowledge of God, and doth reſiſt it; but yet at length being broken, it doth yeelde, and is willingly bound with happy bonds.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. To that place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. where hee prayeth that God would powerfully finiſh the worke of faith in the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> they of the <hi>Hage, pag.</hi> 295. doe anſwere. That the Apoſtle doth not ſpeake of the beginning of faith; <hi>but of the complement in the encreaſe and perſeuerance of faith:</hi> By which ſpeech, they cut their owne throats; for if there be neede of ſo great ſtrength and power of God, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the encreaſes of faith, how much more power is
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:11390:224"/>there neede of, for the beginnings of faith, and to put faith in an vnbeleeuing man, in whom there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which doth not reſiſt God?</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. They adde, that by the worke of faith, is vnderſtood patience, but vnfitly; for the worke of faith is not finiſhed onely by the tolerating and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of afflictions; alſo the words of the Apoſtle go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, doe reiect this interpretation: For he ſaith, <hi>We pray alwayes for you, that God would count you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this calling; and fulfill all the good pleaſure of his goodneſſe, and the worke of faith with power:</hi> He doth wickedly, who reſtraineth the calling of God and the effects of the good pleaſure of his goodneſſe to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience alone.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. In the ſame place they gueſſe, that this fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is the obtaining of glory. But in vaine, for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not the perfection, nor the fulfilling of the worke of faith, but the fulfilling of the reward which wee apprehend by faith; yea, the worke of faith is ſo farre from being there perfected, that it will then ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The men of our partie proued this by that place of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Epheſ. Chap</hi> 1. <hi>Verf.</hi> 3. <hi>The diuine power hath giuen vnto vs all things which pertaine vnto life and godlineſſe, through the knowledge of him who hath called vs to glory and vertue.</hi> If God doth giue vs all things which pertaine to life and pietie, then hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs that we ſhall not reſiſt finally, but obey God calling. The <hi>Arminians</hi> anſwere, that <hi>Peter</hi> here doth not ſpeake of the beſtowing of faith, and that he doth not teach that faith is giuen to vs by God, but onely of thoſe things which hee giueth to them that doe
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:11390:225"/>already beleeue. This anſwere is beſides the matter, and it doth not touch any part of our argument: Yet when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>all things,</hi> are giuen vs by God, which are neceſſary to ſaluation, they deale ſincerely and faithfully, in that they will not haue faith to be comprehended vnder this word, <hi>omnia,</hi> all things. For they which ſay in other places, that faith is the gift of God, doe here plainely enough witnes that this was not ſeriouſly and in good earneſt ſpoken by them. And truely, the men on our ſide doe bring no place out of the Scripture, to proue that faith is the gift of God, which the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe not corrupt and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; becauſe they deny that the habit of faith is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into man, or imprinted on mens hearts by God: but they contend, that it is giuen to vs by God no otherwiſe then by perſwading, and by giuing powers by which wee may beleeue, if wee our ſelues will. Which truely is not to giue faith, but to giue helpes &amp; incitations, to obey which, and to turne them into vſe, is in the power of free-will. To adde to their fraud and deceit, they doe corrupt the words of Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>That God hath giuen vs all things that are neceſſary to life and godlineſſe:</hi> They, by <hi>giuing,</hi> would haue <hi>offering and propounding</hi> to be vnderſtood, which doe very much differ: For ſeeing that (as the <hi>Arminians</hi> confeſſe) eternall life is propounded euen to reprobates, it will be ſaid, that eternall life is giuen to the reprobates, if to propound and offer be the ſame that it is to giue.</p>
               <p>That faith and repentance is from God the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proueth. That faith is the gift of God Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By Grace ye are ſaued through
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:11390:225"/>faith, and that not of your ſelues, it is the gift of God.</hi> That gift of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh here, is neither ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation alone, nor faith alone: But this is the gift, <hi>To be ſaued by grace through faith.</hi> Whence it appeareth that faith is as well comprehended vnder this gift, as ſaluation. But if ſaluation alone were here called the gift of God, yet it would thence neceſſarily follow, that faith is the gift of God: For he that giueth ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt needes alſo giue the meanes, without which there is no ſaluation. The ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. ſaith, <hi>It is giuen to you in the behalfe of Chriſt, not onely to beleeue on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> Doe you ſee that it is giuen to vs, not onely to be able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, but alſo the act of beleeuing, and to beleeue it ſelfe? That repentance is the gift of God, Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> doth witneſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>God hath exalted Christ with his right hand, to be a prince and a Sauiour, for to giue repentance to Iſrael, and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>If God will at any time giue them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5. doth ſay. <hi>That the loue of God is ſhed abroade in our hearts by the holy-Ghoſt, who is giuen vs; To wit,</hi> becauſe the holy-Ghoſt doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print that ſure confidence in our hearts, that wee are loued by God. Here you ſee that not onely the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, of willing and doeing, are giuen by God, but alſo to will and to doe it ſelfe. Seeing therefore that as many Chriſtian vertues as there are, there are ſo many gifts of God, and the ſame vertues are habits, it muſt needes be, that thoſe habits are from God, and therefore not engrafted by nature, which <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> himſelfe hath not ſaid; nor obtained by vſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the grace of God helping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the <hi>Arminians</hi>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:11390:226"/>will haue it, for ſo man himſelfe ſhould giue eyther all faith, or at the leaſt ſome part of faith to himſelfe, and ſhould owe it to his owne labour and induſtry. For truely, if God doth giue the power of beleeuing, and doth not giue the act of beleeuing after the ſame manner as he giueth the power, becauſe (as theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries thinke) God doth giue the power of beleeuing vnreſiſtibly, but he giueth the act of beleeuing onely by perſwading and inuiting, and that by a perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we may obey or reſiſt; conſent to, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe: There is nothing ſo cleere, as that the very act of beleeuing, and therefore faith it ſelfe, is not from God alone, nor from the meere grace of God, but is due, partly to God, and partly to mans free-will. Which that it is the opinion of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and that they thinke that grace is not the totall, but part-cauſe of faith, we haue proued before. Whereunto adde that which they ſay, that God doth giue faith no otherwiſe then by perſwading, and by a gentle invitation: Which if it be true, it will be ſaid that God doth giue neither the power nor act of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. For he that doth onely perſwade and exhort to runne, although he ſet on fire all the brands of his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Art, yet he will neuer be ſaid to giue the power of running, nor to runne it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. Seeing therefore that the habit of faith, is the gift of God, it muſt needes be, that it is infuſed and imprinted on our hearts by God himſelfe; which if it be ſo, it is vnpoſſible that this infuſion can be hindred in the elect; For what ſhould hinder it? Doth the mutability and inſtability of the decree of God hinder it? No; His decrees can neither be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:11390:226"/>nor changed. Doth the euill affection of the heart of man hinder it? No, euery man is ill affected before he hath receiued faith from God. Doth the obſtinate hardneſſe of ſome men hinder it? No, this hardneſſe is ſoftned by faith being receiued: Which alſo God promiſeth that he will doe, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.26.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. This promiſe of God, and others of the like ſort, by which God promiſeth that he will giue a heart of fleſh, and will write on it his law, and that he will cauſe that we ſhould walke in his waies, doe promiſe an infallible certainty of the conuerſion of the elect, and the grace of God, which is impoſſible finally to faile: For what can hinder that God ſhould not ſtand to his promiſe, and ſhould fulfill that which he hath certainely and abſolutely promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Doth the hardneſſe of mans heart hinder? No, this is that which he doth promiſes, <hi>to wit,</hi> that he will ſoften the ſtony heart. Doth the wickedneſſe of man hinder? No, there is no man but he is wicked before God conuerteth him. Is it the ſtubbornneſſe which is in ſome men more then ordinary? No, <hi>Where ſinne abounded, there alſo grace abounded.</hi> Finally, there can no impediment be obiected, which God cannot put away and remoue. There is nothing ſo intricate, out of which the wiſe goodneſſe of God cannot cleere himſelfe; and therefore to whom hee promiſed hee would giue a new ſpirit, that hee would take from them their ſtony heart, that he would cauſe that they ſhould walke in his waies, it is impoſſible that theſe ſhould not be conuerted, or ſhould finally fall away. Neither doe the <hi>Arminians</hi> themſelues deny it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:11390:227"/>they ſeeme contentiouſly to ſtriue againſt it. For, in the 286. <hi>page,</hi> of the conference at the <hi>Hage,</hi> they doe confeſſe that theſe words of God in <hi>Ezechiel, It is declared that God will ſo effectually worke, that actuall obedience muſt follow:</hi> But (ſay they) is that done vnreſiſtibly? As if the controuerſie were in that: It is ſufficient that it is done moſt certainely, infallibly, and vnauoidably, although man ſhould for a time reſiſt, and ſhould be aduerſe and contrary to God calling, <hi>that is,</hi> to his owne ſaluation: For the workes of piety, which are adioyned to follow this change of the heart, are not laid downe as conditions, on which this change is to be, but as fruites and effects which are to follow this change of the heart.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Theſe Sectaries doe deuiſe another hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hole, in ſaying that this promiſe of giuing a new heart, was made to a whole nation, not to ſeuerall men: But theſe are vaine things. For, Regeneration, and the change of the heart, is a gift which is giuen to particular men: Neither were this promiſe true, if it were to be performed to a whole nation, in which there haue alwaies beene very many that haue beene ſtubborne and rebellious: Therefore this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe pertaineth to thoſe alone who were to be truely faithfull.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. They diſpute neuer a whit more wittily, when they ſay, <hi>Collat. pag.</hi> 269. that by theſe places is promiſed, not the firſt beginning of preuenting grace, but a greater plenty and progreſſe of grace. I doe not deny but that euen the progreſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in grace is promiſed here; but I earneſtly
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:11390:227"/>affirme, that here the beginnings alſo of conuerſion are promiſed: The very words <hi>a new heart,</hi> doe proue this: For then truely and properly is the heart new, when it begins to be changed: Nor is it credible, that the increaſe of grace is promiſed without the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. I further demand, whether that promiſe whereby God promiſeth that he will cauſe that wee ſhall walke in his wayes, is extended to the end of the life, or for a ſhort time: If not to the end, then this promiſe is in vaine, yea, and abſurd, becauſe by it God ſhould promiſe that he would ſo long giue them his grace, vntill he ſhould againe take it away, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them for euer. Alſo the words themſelues doe witneſſe, that it is ſpoken of a perpetuall grace. For God doth promiſe, that he will cauſe that they ſhould not depart from his waies; in which words, finall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance is promiſed.</p>

And if the grace of God may be finally hindred in all and particular men, it might come to paſſe that it ſhould be hindred in all men; and ſo there wold be none elected, there would be no church, and Chriſt ſhould haue dyed in vaine. For nothing can be imagined more abſurd, then to ſuppoſe that God decreed that ſome men ſhould beleeue and be ſaued, and that that ſhould be done vnreſiſtibly; and yet that he did not decree of any one man, nor of any particular perſon: There is nothing more abſurd, then to determine, that it muſt needes be that ſome be ſaued, and yet that there is no man who may not be damned. By what meanes can any certainety be made or concluded out of many vncertainties? Or is it
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:11390:228"/>credible and likely, that the decree of God as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole Church, cannot be deluded, and yet may be made fruſtrate in the ſeuerall members of the Church?</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. Nor doth the truth finde any ſmall refuge in the words of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44.45. <hi>No man can come to me, except the father, who hath ſent me, draw him; and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day. It is written in the Prophets; They ſhall be all taught of God. Euery man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the father, commeth to me.</hi> Euery word is a thunderbolt. The <hi>Arminians</hi> thinke, that there are many that heare and learne of the father, who doe not come, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. This is diametrically and directly contrary to the words of Chriſt; <hi>Euery man that hath heard, and hath learned of the father, commeth to me.</hi> For he ſpeaketh of a certaine manner of hearing and learning, which is peculiar to the elect, and which doth worke in their heart what he commandeth. The ſame <hi>Arminians</hi> doe affirme, that many are drawne, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doe not come. But here alſo they offend againſt the words of Chriſt, where he ſaith, <hi>No man can come to me, except the father draw him, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.</hi> For he ſpeaketh of a certaine ſure kinde of drawing and obedience, by which whoſoeuer are drawne, and doe come, ſhall be raiſed vp by Chriſt at the laſt day. Hee ſpeaketh therefore of a kinde of drawing which cannot finally be reſiſted.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. Out of the ſame place of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is framed: <hi>Whoſoeuer hath heard, and hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the father, doth come: Whoſoeuer is drawne hath heard &amp; learned:</hi> Therfore whoſoeuer is drawne, doth come.</p>
               <pb n="465" facs="tcp:11390:228"/>
               <p n="20">XX. By the ſame place, the opinion of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> is refuted, whereby they teach, that all men are drawne, and that ſufficient grace is giuen to all: For the ſcope of Chriſt is to ſet downe the cauſe, why the Iewes of Capernaum could not come, <hi>to wit,</hi> becauſe they were not drawne by the Father; that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he might teach, that they would haue come if they had beene drawne: by which words, hee doth not obſcurely teach, that all who are drawne doe come.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. Theſe proofes, brought out of this place, are not grounded on the word <hi>drawing,</hi> which wee know to be many times taken more largely, and to be ſometimes vſed for an invitation which is not obeyed; but they are grounded on the whole cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this place, and on the courſe of the ſpeech, which doth more then certainely demonſtrate, that it is here ſpoken of a kinde of drawing, with which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer are drawne, doe come. In which ſenſe, the word <hi>drawing</hi> is vſed, in the beginning of the <hi>Canticles; Draw mee, and we will runne after thee:</hi> Which alſo Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth acknowledge, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. againſt the two Epiſtles of the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> where when hee had admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Reader, that Chriſt did not ſay, <hi>lead,</hi> but <hi>draw,</hi> he addeth: <hi>Who is drawne, if he be already wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? And yet no man commeth, vnleſſe he be willing: He is therefore after a marueilous manner drawne, that he ſhould be willing, by him who knoweth to worke inwardly in the very hearts of men, not that men vnwilling ſhould beleeue, (which cannot be) but that of vnwilling, they might be made willing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">XXII. Nor is it credible that that grace is finally
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:11390:229"/>reſiſtible, whoſe chiefe office is to take away finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; for ſo it ſhould not doe that for which it is ordained; eſpecially ſeeing that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoeuer drinketh of the water that I ſhall giue him, ſhall neuer thirſt, but the water which I ſhall giue him, ſhall be in him a well of water, ſpringing vp to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> For it doth manifeſtly appeare, that it is here ſpoken of a kinde of grace, which being once well admitted and receiued into the heart, is neuer loſt, but doth remaine to eternall life, and like an euerlaſting fountaine, is neuer dryed: No leſſe direct are the words of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.35. <hi>He that beleeueth in me, ſhall neuer thirſt:</hi> and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 51. <hi>He that ſhall eate of this bread, ſhall liue for euer:</hi> All which were falſe, if true faith, which doth ſeriouſly apprehend Chriſt, might be ſhaken off, and be finally loſt: For then there would be ſome, who after the eating of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bread, ſhould periſh for euer.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. And if there be any certainty of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any full perſwaſion of the Saints, it muſt needs be, that the grace of God in them cannot be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, nor finally extinguiſhed; for otherwiſe, this certainety were vaine and deceitfull: For how can he be certaine of his ſaluation, who doth beleeue that the grace of God may be hindred and aboliſhed by a finall reſiſtance? And that on Gods part there is no abſolute and peremptory election, but when the courſe of our life is finiſhed? And that on mans part, the free-will of man in moſt holy men is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with power whereby it may altogether driue away the ſpirit of God?</p>

<pb n="467" facs="tcp:11390:229"/>doth teach and command certaine and ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of our ſaluation.

Surely the Scripture doth teach how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this inward teſtimony is, while it calleth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a ſeale deepely imprinting the promiſes of God on our hearts, and the pledge of our inheritance, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.30. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. So alſo 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that beleeueth on the ſonne of God, hath the witneſſe of God in himſelfe.</hi> This teſtimony is beyond all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which teſtimony whoſoeuer doth not feele in himſelfe, he ought rather to thinke ill of himſelfe, then to meaſure other men by his owne foote, and to iudge of others confidence, by his owne incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie.</p>

The firſt certainty is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawne from that election which is abſolute, and is not for faith fore-ſeene, but not the latter: Becauſe God hath decreed many things concerning vs, whereof hee hath not yet giuen vs the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The full perſwaſion of the faithfull doth not reſt on any reuelation, whereby God hath laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to vs the ſecrets of his counſels, but on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel, and on the inward feeling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one ſearching himſelfe, doth feele that he doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly beleeue in Chriſt, and on the inward teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſpirit, witneſſing in our hearts that we are the ſonnes of God: Yet there may be many, and thoſe good and godly men, who although they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the election of God, haue not come to this full confidence.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> being beaten in this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and exerciſed in often contentions of the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> is a moſt earneſt maintainer of the former certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and doth gather from the election of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his purpoſe, that the elect can neuer be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by God, and that grace is giuen which can neuer faile, and by which they ſhall certainely perſeuere. There are many excellent things in his workes to this purpoſe, but he doth no where ſpeake more plainely then in his booke, <hi>de correp. &amp; gratia.</hi> which hee writ when he was very old. In the twelfth Chapter hee hath theſe words: <hi>There is giuen to the Saints that are
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:11390:231"/>predeſtinated by the grace of God to the kingdome of God, not onely ſuch helpe of grace, but alſo ſuch a helpe, that perſeuerance it ſelfe is giuen them, not onely that without that gift they could not perſeuere, but alſo that by this gift they cannot but perſeuere. For he hath not onely ſaid, without me ye can doe nothing, but he hath alſo ſaid, yee haue not choſen me, but I haue choſen you, and haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed you that you might goe on, and might beare fruit, and that your fruit might remaine: In which words hee declareth that he hath giuen them not onely righteouſneſſe, but alſo perſeuerance in righteouſneſſe. For Chriſt ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing them, that they ſhould goe on and beare fruit, and that their fruit ſhould remaine, who dare ſay that perhaps it ſhall not remaine? For the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance,</hi> that is, <hi>the calling of them who are called according to his purpoſe. Chriſt therefore making interceſsion for theſe, that their faith ſhould not faile, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it ſhall not faile to the end, and by this it ſhall perſeuere to the end, and the end of this life ſhall finde it remaining.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And a little after, <hi>The will of them is ſo much enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the holy-Ghoſt, that they therefore are able, becauſe they ſo will, and they doe therefore ſo will, becauſe God worketh in them that they may will: For if in ſo great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of this life (in which, notwithſtanding it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that vertue ſhould be wrought for the repreſsing of pride) mens wills ſhould be left to themſelues, that if they would they might remaine in the helpe and aſsiſtance of God, without which they could not perſeuere, and God ſhould not worke in them that they might will: The will it ſelfe, by its owne infirmity, would faile among ſo many and ſo great temptations, and they could not therefore perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:11390:232"/>becauſe failing by their infirmity they could not be willing, or by the infirmity of their will they could not be ſo willing that they might be able: Therefore the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mans will was helped, that by the grace of God it might be driuen</hi> vnauoidably, and inſeperably; <hi>and therefore, although weake, yet it ſhould not faile, nor be ouercome by any aduerſitie. Hee ſuffered and permitted</hi> Adam, <hi>the ſtrongeſt man, to doe what he would, but hee hath preſerued to the weake, that they ſhould will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincibly, by him that giueth it, and inuincibly ſhould not forſake it.</hi>

And yet he doth vſe the word <hi>reſiſting, Chap.</hi> 14. where he thus ſpeaketh: <hi>No free-will of man doth reſiſt, God being willing to ſaue. For to will or nill, is ſo in the power of him that willeth or nil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that it cannot hinder the will of God, nor ouercome his power.</hi> Excellently ſpoken, although <hi>Arminius</hi> cry out againſt it.</p>

               <p n="1">I. VNreſiſtibleneſſe is painted, by the <hi>Arminians,</hi> as a monſter, whoſe beard they pluck, &amp; whom they prick with needles and goades. We haue already

Doe deny that they ſay, <hi>That the holy-Ghost doth worke vpon the will by no other meanes then ſuch as may be reſiſted.

For if God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert ſome men vnreſiſtibly, and doth giue them faith by his preciſe and abſolute will, it is impoſſible that theſe ſhould be elected for faith fore-ſeene, and by an election which doth reſt on the fore-ſeeing of faith. For he who is abſolutely and vnreſiſtibly appointed to faith, muſt needes be abſolutely appointed to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. He ſhould doe fooliſhly, who ſhould faigne God decreeing thus; <hi>I indeede decreed to ſaue this man, if he will beleeue: But I will giue him faith vnreſiſtibly.</hi> Election cannot depend on the fore-ſeeing of that
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:11390:233"/>condition which God hath decreed certainely and infallibly to doe. Thus God did not decree that <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould liue if hee had breath; but hee hath certainely decreed to giue him breath, that he might liue.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Hence it appeareth, with what equity theſe Sectaries deale with vs: For falſely attributing <hi>vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibleneſſe</hi> to vs, they cry out, that thereby mens wills are compelled, and that it cannot be called obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to which man is vnreſiſtibly compelled; yet the ſame men doe thinke that there are ſome who are conuerted vnreſiſtibly, and after an extraordinary manner, and whoſe conuerſion they doe not deny to be obedience.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Adde to theſe, that old and worne opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Arminians,</hi> which we euery where meete in their writings: That God doth call ſome man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a manner that is not congruent and agreeable, whereby they that are called doe neuer follow, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be able to follow: That ſome againe are called in that manner, ſtate, meaſure, and time, which is congruent and agreeable, by which meanes whoſoeuer are called, doe certainely and infallibly follow God calling. Alſo wee haue before in the 44. <hi>Chapter,</hi> brought the words of <hi>Armini us</hi> himſelfe, whereby he determineth that ſuch a calling is made by the decree of God, and adminiſtred by his certain and ſure predeſtination: And iuſtly; For why ſhould God chooſe this apt ſtate, this fit time, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent manner, whereby they that are called doe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely and infallibly follow, vnleſſe becauſe he will haue them certainely and infallibly to follow? Surely
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:11390:233"/>theſe things maintaine the ſame vnreſiſtibleneſſe which is beleeued by vs, <hi>that is,</hi> a certaine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble euent from the preordination of God.

               <p n="6">VI. The ſame men doe ſtabliſh vnreſiſtibleneſſe by that their old opinion, whereby they teach, that God in our conuerſion doth vnreſiſtibly enlighten the vnderſtanding, and ſtirre vp the affection. It is ſomething, that they confeſſe that part of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and regeneration is wrought vnreſiſtibly, <hi>to wit,</hi> the enlightning of the minde &amp; the rayſing vp of the affections. But I further affirme, that by that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible enlightning of the minde, if it be cleere and euident, and by that raiſing of the affections, if it be vehement, the will is neceſſarily affected, and drawne to a ſpontaneus aſſent, as wee haue at large proued.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. They doe no leſſe hurt and wound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, when they teach that the power of beleeuing is giuen vnreſiſtibly: For, what powers of beleeuing are there but by faith? For, habits are the efficient cauſes of operations, as the firſt acts are the cauſes of the ſecond. Or what powers of beleeuing can there
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:11390:234"/>be without faith? If therefore the powers of beleeuing are giuen vnreſiſtibly, it is plaine, that faith alſo, and therefore the aſſent of the will, is giuen vnreſiſtably, ſeeing that the power and faculty of beleeuing is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced formally in faith it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> of the <hi>Hage, Collat. pag.</hi> 269. doe grant, that God doth vnreſiſtibly cauſe, that alway there are ſome who beleeue: By which grant they doe plainely diſturbe their owne matters. For who are theſe <hi>ſome?</hi> Are they not ſome certaine perſons? Therefore God doth vnreſiſtibly worke, that certaine perſons ſhould beleeue. Is it likely that God doth vnreſiſtibly cauſe that ſome ſhould beleeue, and hath not appointed who they ſhould be? For ſo it would come to paſſe that God predeſtinated ſome men to beleeue vnreſiſtibly, and that he predeſtinated none. Is it poſſible that God ſhould cauſe, that ſome men ſhould beleeue vnreſiſtibly, and yet tbat the ſame men ſhould not beleeue vnreſiſtibly? As if I ſhould ſay, that God doth cauſe that ſome ſhould die, who yet certainely doe not die. And ſeeing by the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Arminius,</hi> there is none of the elect, who may not be reprobated, and cauſe that God ſhould be diſappointed of his intention, it is a meruaile how God ſhould cauſe vnreſiſtibly that ſome ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, when there is none of them who beleeue and are conuerted, but many finally reſiſt, and ſo periſh. Whatſoeuer may happen to ſeuerall men, may alſo happen to all. Nor can the purpoſe of God be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, of cauſing vnreſiſtibly that ſome ſhould be conuerted, vnleſſe ſome be vnreſiſtibly conuerted. Euen as the purpoſe of God, of cauſing ſome to be
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:11390:234"/>drowned cannot be certaine, vnleſſe ſome be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>The ſame men, <hi>Collat pag.</hi> 292. ſay; <hi>That to conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there is required a power which muſt in many parts exceede euery created power, although it ſhould not worke vnreſiſtibly: For that nature may be effectually conuerted, ſomething is required that is more powerfull then it ſelfe.</hi> Theſe things ſeeme to me to be ſuch as cannot ſtand together; that the power of the ſpirit, by which wee are conuerted, doth in many parts exceede the power of nature; and yet that it may be ſo reſiſted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it may be ouercome, and may finally be hindred: for of ſuch a reſiſtance is it ſpoken here.</p>
               <p>There is no cauſe therefore to feare leſt irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, being thruſt at by the <hi>Arminians,</hi> ſhould fall downe, ſeeing that on the one part they doe hold it vp, and vnderproppe it from falling, yet it is worth the labour to know with what obiections they doe enforce it.</p>

This their foundation, ſeeing it hath beene ouerwhelmed and caſt downe by vs, the other things which they would build vpon this muſt needes fall.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Arminian</hi> conferrers at the <hi>Hage,</hi> doe very ill heape together many things, to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing whereof there is neede of no great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the front of the battell, they ſet that place in the <hi>Acts, Chapter</hi> 7.15. Where <hi>Stephen</hi> doth lay it to the charge of the rebellious Iewes, that they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies reſiſted the holy-Ghoſt: Whence they inferre, that the holy-Ghoſt, when he worketh in man, doth not worke conuerſion vnreſiſtibly.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But they doe vnwiſely proue that which is not in controuerſie. For we doe not teach, we doe not acknowledge that irreſiſtibility which they attribute to vs. This concluſion therefore doth not hurt vs, who doe willingly confeſſe that the holy-Ghoſt doth not alwaies ſo worke in mens hearts that hee taketh away all reſiſtance. Furthermore, they ſuppoſe a thing which is moſt falſe, as a thing true and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the holy-Ghoſt wrought in thoſe Iewes, and that they reſiſted the inward operation of the Spirit. <hi>Stephen</hi> chargeth the Iewes, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies reſiſted the eu dent teſtimony of the holy-Ghoſt, ſpeaking by the Prophets. This the following words of <hi>Stephen</hi> doe declare: <hi>Which of the Prophets haue not your fathers perſecuted? &amp;c.</hi> Nor if <hi>Stephen</hi>

               <p n="4">IV. With this place, there likewiſe fall to the ground thoſe places in which the Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaith, that the Iewes tempted God, and ſtirred him vp to wrath, and made ſad the ſpirit of his holineſſe; that the chickens would not be gathered; that they who were called refuſed; &amp;c. All theſe (ſay I) are nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The Scripture there ſpeaketh of vngodly and rebellious perſons; but in this queſtion it is ſpoken of the faithfull and the elect; and the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be that they may neuer be conuerted, and may finally reſiſt the ſpirit of adoption. To the prouing of this, the places which ſpeaketh of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, which we confeſſe doe finally reſiſt God calling, and doe want the ſpirit of adoption, are plainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the purpoſe. Finally, theſe Sectaries doe not proue, that in all theſe places it is ſpoken of a finall reſiſtance, of which alone it is ſpoken here.</p>
               <p>But (ſay they) God, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 18.31. doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Iſraelites to make them a new heart, and a new ſpirit. Whence they gather that man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what he is commanded, or reſiſt God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. I am aſhamed of this olde trifle and <hi>Pelagian</hi> colewort, ſo often brought againe, and as often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. Firſt of all, what neede is there to proue that an vnregenerate man is able not to obey this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:11390:236"/>of making him a new heart, ſeeing this alone he is able to doe, <hi>to wit,</hi> nor to obey; and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obey? And that man can doe whatſoeuer God commandeth is an hereſie of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> already confuted by vs The precepts of God are not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our powers, but the rule of our duty, the ſumme of our debt, the matter of our prayers, the ſcope of our ſtrife. But of theſe things more then enough.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Fourthly, they pretend that place, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. <hi>What could more haue beene done to my Vineyard, which I haue not done to it?</hi> Whence they inferre, that the grace of God doth not worke conuerſion in man vnreſiſtibly. This is a prodigious conſequence; and if it were good, yet the concluſion would touch neither the queſtion, nor vs; who confeſſe that in the elect themſelues, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion is not wrought without ſome reſiſtance. Adde to theſe, that to the queſtion wherein it is ſpoken of the conuerſion of ſeuerall men, a place ſpeaking of the calling of a whole nation is vnwiſely brought. When it is ſpoken of the certainty of the conuerſion of the elect, they ought not to bring a place ſpeaking of the rebellion of an incredulous and vnbeleeuing nation. Finally, they deale ſo as they who are very carefull, leſt they ſhould ſay any thing that ſhould make to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. By the way, the Reader ſhall obſerue, that vnproper phraſes, and ſpoken after the manner of men, ought not to be taken as properly ſpoken. God is figuratiuely ſaid to haue wiſhed and expected fruit from his vine. Deſires, and griefe, as if hauing ſpent his labour in vaine he had failed of his propounded
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:11390:236"/>end, cannot happen to God: When God doth wiſh the conuerſion of men, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.14. he doth inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate nothing elſe, then that the conuerſion of man is acceptable to him: So when he is ſaid to expect fruit from the Vine, or from the Fig-tree, <hi>that is,</hi> from the Church, or from particular men; and when the Vine diſappointed his hope, not preſently to plucke it vp by the rootes; vnderſtand, that God doth require and demand obedience, and that when that which ought to be done is not done, he is not preſently rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to puniſh, but doth deferre it, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.9. God doth not expect thoſe euents which hee fore-knoweth will not come to paſſe: Much leſſe doth he expect thoſe euents in the godly, which hee himſelfe is to worke.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. They ſtumble at the ſame ſtone, when they cite that of <hi>Ezechiel, Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Sonne of man, thou dwelleſt in the midſt of a rebellious houſe, who haue eyes to ſee, and ſee not, &amp;c.</hi> Whence they inferre that man indeede hath eyes, and eares, and power of conuerting himſelfe, but he is able to reſiſt. Vnwiſely ſpoken; for who doth deny that man is able to reſiſt? yea, of his owne nature hee can doe nothing elſe. Why doe they heape vp to vs the examples of reprobates and wicked men, in the queſtion whereby it is deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whether it may come to paſſe that hee who is elected can finally reſiſt grace, and fall from it? By the way, the Reader ſhall remember, that of the ſame people to whom eares &amp; eyes are here attributed, God doth thus ſpeake, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>The Lord hath not giuen you a heart to vnderſtand, nor eyes to ſee, nor eares to heare, to this day.</hi> For there are two kindes of eyes,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:11390:237"/>ſome, which onely the faithfull haue, <hi>to wit,</hi> the eyes of faith; ſome, which reprobates may haue, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and willing doe periſh; who <hi>ſeeing doe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and doe heare heauily with their eares, Mat.</hi> 13.26.27. theſe mens eyes are carnall and cloudy; theſe men, naturall reaſon being their guide, haue a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall knowledge which doth not affect the heart, or if any diuine light hath riſen to them, it doth rather dazle their eyes then enlighten them; yea, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they haue, they endeauour to choake, willingly groping at noone day.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The places of Scripture which they adde, they doe in the ſame manner miſ-alleadge, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Eſay</hi> 6.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.25. and 26. By which places, no other thing can be proued, then that repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and rebellious perſons may refuſe the grace of God, and reſiſt his admonitions; which we willingly confeſſe: But what is this to finall reſiſtance in the Elect?</p>
               <p n="10">X. They doe gloriouſly boaſt of the words of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Woe vnto thee Corazin, woe vnto thee Bethſaida; for if the mighty workes which were done in you, had beene done in Tyre and Sydon, they would haue repented long agoe in ſacke-cloath and aſhes.</hi> The like place you haue, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3.6. Out of the place of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> they thus diſpute.</p>

                  <l>
                     <hi>That grace by which ſome men, to whom it is giuen, haue not beene conuerted, and others had beene conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if the ſame had beene giuen to them, is reſiſtible.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>But the grace of conuerſion is ſuch.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Therefore the grace of conuerſion doth not worke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly.</hi>

               </q>
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:11390:237"/>
               <p>There was no cauſe that they ſhould ſo labour in the prouing of either propoſition, ſeeing wee willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admit of the concluſion: Wee know that the elect themſelues doe reſiſt the grace of God, although not perpetually, nor ſo that the grace of God ſhould be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally hindred. The queſtion is, whether it may come to paſſe, that the elect may ſo reſiſt the grace of God, that they may neuer be conuerted, or that they may extinguiſh it, and finally hinder it. The good men doe not touch this queſtion, but doe wander other where.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Yet doe they not vphold thoſe two propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with fit proofes. The Maior and firſt propoſition they thus proue: <hi>If Grace worke conuerſion in man by an vnreſiſtible force, it ſhould alwayes and euery where worke with the like efficacy.</hi> But I deny that that will follow: For although grace ſhould vnreſiſtibly worke conuerſion in all men that are conuerted, yet it might come to paſſe, that it ſhould worke in ſome men with greater efficacie, <hi>to wit,</hi> in thoſe who are ſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that they doe preſently and without delay fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God calling, and are inflamed with greater zeale and feruency then others, who obey more ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſlowly.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. They proue the Minor and ſecond propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the example of the men of <hi>Tyre:</hi> But they ſuppoſe (without any proofe) that Chriſt in this place doth ſpeake of true conuerſion, by which they are conuerted to whom God doth giue true faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: Which ſurely is a great demand. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> did not pertaine to the election of God, becauſe they neuer were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:11390:238"/>if the miracles had beene done amongſt them, which were done amongſt the men of <hi>Corazin,</hi> they might haue beene touched with a reuerence, and haue beene affected with the ſence of their ſinne, and haue beene caſt downe with that repentance which is bred by the feare of puniſhment; ſuch as was the repentance of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. and of the greater part of the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> as the ruine of <hi>Niniuie</hi> a while after doth declare, as we learne, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.1. and out of the laſt Chapter of <hi>Tobias.</hi> In which thing, the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> had beene more praiſe-worthy, then the men of <hi>Corazin,</hi> who among ſo many miracles did not feele the leaſt touch of griefe, nor gaue any ſignes of repentance. But I deny, that it was in the power of the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> to obtaine true faith, and to perſeuere in it: without which yet there is no true repentance. And truely the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſeeme to me to accuſe God of deceitfull enuie, and ill will, becauſe hee knew that the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> were ſo affected, that if thoſe miracles had come to them, they had ſeriouſly repented, and come to ſaluation; and yet he enuied this benefit to them, which notwithſtanding he beſtowed on a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom hee knew would neither be conuerted by miracles, nor by preaching.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. In the ſeauenth place they thus diſpute:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They who may reſiſt the word of Grace and ſaluation, may alſo reſiſt the ſpirit of repentance. But men may reſiſt the word of grace and ſaluation: Therefore the ſame men may alſo reſiſt the ſpirit of repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We admit of the concluſion in that ſence which I haue often ſaid. They proue the Minor by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reprobates, whom we know doe finally reſiſt:
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:11390:238"/>But here it is ſpoken of the elect, and the queſtion is, whether they may ſo reſiſt grace that grace may be ouercome and finally extinguiſhed. This which is the thing to be proued, and is the ſtate of the queſtion, they leaue vntouched.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Being driuen from the Scripture, they flye to Reaſon, and thus frame a Syllogiſme:
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>That which is required of vs in the Goſpell for due and filiall obedience, that is not wronght in vs by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible power.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>But faith and repentance are required of vs in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell for due and filiall obedience:</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Therefore they are not wrought in vs by an vnreſiſtible power.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Minor hath no neede of proofe. The Maior they proue thus; becauſe <hi>that which is onely done in man by another, ſo that he onely behaueth himſelfe paſsiuely in it, cannot be called obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe things are grounded on a double calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: The firſt is, whereby they faigne that wee teach that conuerſion is wrought in vs vnreſiſtibly: The other, whereby they attribute to vs, that we ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and faith is wrought by God without vs; and that men in conuerſion behaue themſelues onely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely. Truely we acknowledge no ſuch conuerſion, in which man ſhould doe nothing but onely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; we know that man is ſo drawne by a ſweet and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall motion, and that his will is ſo bent and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that of vnwilling he is made willing, and doth worke, and is moued of his owne accord: We know that it is man himſelfe that doth beleeue and repent, and not God. But we ſay that God doth giue to man,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:11390:239"/>that he may be able to beleeue and repent: No other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the fruit doth moue it ſelfe in the wombe, and yet the motion it ſelfe and the power of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, it hath from God: It is ſufficient to obedience, that man doth voluntarily obey God.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. And here we entreate the Reader that hee would ſtay a little, and take notice, how inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately the <hi>Arminians</hi> deale here, and how aduerſe and contrary they are to themſelues. They deny that conuerſion can be called obedience, if man doe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behaue himſelfe paſſiuely in it: But they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues teach, that man doth onely behaue himſelfe paſſiuely, in the beginning of his conuerſion, which yet all the <hi>Arminians</hi> acknowledge to be obedience. Their words are theſe in their Epiſtle againſt the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrians, pag.</hi> 69. and 70. <hi>Whether we ſay that the will is moued by the ſpirit onely by the fore-going operations of the vnderstanding or that there is a certaine new energeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and operatiue quality infuſed to it, we alwaies deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that the will is firſt moued,</hi> that is, <hi>behaueth it ſelfe paſsiuely, before it doth actiuely moue it ſelfe to that which is good.</hi> This they ſay, but that is eſpecially to be noted, that the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe with one mouth teach, that the vnderſtanding is vnreſiſtibly enlightned by God; <hi>that is,</hi> that knowledge is ſo giuen by God that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſiſted, when yet that knowledge is a kinde of obedience. For the Scripture doth euery where command vs to know and vnderſtand, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.10. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. Is not the earneſt alacrity of the Angels, to fulfill the commands of God, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? yet they cannot reſiſt God commanding, nor can they deſire to reſiſt.</p>
               <pb n="487" facs="tcp:11390:239"/>
               <p n="16">XVI. Laſtly, they heape together abſurdities, which they think may be drawn for that power which they call irreſiſtible: They ſay that it doth follow from thence, that no other can be conuerted then they that are indeede conuerted: And that no man can be conuerted, before hee be conuerted indeede. But this ought to be ſo farre from ſeeming abſurd, that on the contrary, it is impious to beleeue that any one may be conuerted and regenerated, but hee whom God doth conuert and regenerate, and to whom he giueth faith and the ſpirit of adoption; or that any one can be conuerted before God conuert him. For if we be all by nature dead in ſinne, it is certaine, that there are no other that can riſe out of that ſpirituall death, then they that doe indeede riſe. And if faith and the ſpirit of adoption is a gift of God proceeding from his meere grace; it is plaine, that they at length can be conuerted to whom God doth giue grace, whereby they may be conuerted in act. And ſeeing we are brought to that paſſe, that there is no man who doth not reſiſt God calling, it appeareth that no man can be conuerted, but he from whom God hath taken away this reſiſtance and hath broke his hardneſſe. Let theſe new Semipelagians looke to it and conſider with what face they dare maintaine, that an vnregenerate man hath power of conuerting himſelfe, before God conuert him in act, and how they can defend themſelues againſt ſo many places of Scripture, and ſo many reaſons and proofes, which we haue brought in the three and thirty Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Can they bring an example (out of all records of Stories) of any one who hath obtained faith and
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:11390:240"/>ſaluation, by thoſe gifts which doe happen to all men, euen to Heathens and vnregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. That no man can conuert himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be conuerted and drawne by God, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth euery where witneſſe: <hi>Conuert vs, and we ſhall be conuerted, Ier.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Lament.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Draw me, and wee will runne after thee, Cant.</hi> 1.4. Could the Thiefe conuert himſelfe, before Chriſt after a meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and vtterable manner changed his heart, among ſo many occaſions of doubting, and in the flight and feare of the Apoſtles themſelues? Could <hi>Paul</hi> conuert himſelfe before he was called from heauen by Chriſt? Surely godly mens eares are vnacquainted with this opinion, and it is of the Pelagian vaine. By this meanes the decree of God is aboliſhed, by which he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vſe the miraculous confeſſion of the Thiefe to ſhew the efficacy of the death of Chriſt, and his diuine power in the very height of griefes and reproaches, and for a notable euidence of the election of grace. God might haue beene diſappointed of theſe ends, if the Thiefe might haue conuerted himſelfe ſome years before. God indeede did not hinder that hee ſhould not be conuerted: but whereas all men of themſelues and of their owne nature are vnable to conuert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, concerning thoſe whom he decreed to conuert, he determined with himſelfe in what time and manner he would conuert them.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>But</hi> (ſay they) <hi>if no man can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, but he whom God doth conuert in deede and in act, it will thence follow that the reſt who are called, are called in vaine, and that God ſhould deale diſſemblingly
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:11390:240"/>and vnwiſely, who ſhould call them to ſaluation, and yet withdraw the meanes neceſſary to obtaine ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere, that this word <hi>withdrawing,</hi> doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proue how vnfaithfully they deale. For there is none of vs thinkes that God doth withdraw from them who are not conuerted, the meanes neceſſary to ſaluation: For if he ſhould withdraw thoſe meanes from them, hee ſhould take from them that which they had: But no vnregenerate man euer had all the meanes neceſſary to ſaluation. It is one thing to withdraw the meanes neceſſary to ſaluation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing not to giue them. It is one thing to pull out the eyes of the blinde, and it is another thing not to cure him that is blinde. It is ſufficiently manifeſt that God doth not giue to all men, all the meanes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſaluation: For there are infinite people, to whom he doth not ſend preachers of the Goſpell: And to very many, to whom the Goſpell is preached hee doth not giue faith and the ſpirit of Adoption. But they alone beleeue, who are fore-ordained to eternall life, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. All which things are aboundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the former Chapters. Neither yet can God therefore be accuſed of folly or diſſembling, who doth call thoſe whom hee knoweth will not follow, &amp; to whom he doth not giue the power of comming. For hee doth not deale diſſemblingly, nor vnwiſely, who doth require from man that which hee is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if he owe it, and if man himſelfe is the cauſe of his diſability. For God hath not loſt his right by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of man; nor is he bound to ſupply to all men the meanes of paying what they owe, and of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:11390:241"/>what they are commanded. Nor doth he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſely or diſſemblingly call the virgins who wanted oyle, although hee would not adminiſter oyle to them, of which they themſelues ought in time to haue had a care. Neither is it any doubt but that God doth require from euery man, yea, from the heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the perfect obedience of the law, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it can be perfectly fulfilled by them, the <hi>Arminians</hi> themſelues, vnleſſe it be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and doubtfully, dare not affirme. God doth not in vaine call thoſe whom he knoweth will not follow, becauſe he doth not deale vainely, who doth exact that which iuſtice doth require. Nor is it equall that although in a promiſcuous and mingled multitude there are many reprobates, the word of God ſhould therefore not be preached to that multitude, and the naughtineſſe of wicked men ſhould defraud the good, and that thereby ſomething ſhould be taken away, and detracted from the commodities of the elect. Nor is the Goſpell preached in vaine to thoſe that are obſtinate, ſeeing that by their obſtinacy, and by the puniſhments that follow it, the godly are brought to a wholeſome feare, and are turned and drawne to prayer, and to the acknowledgement of the mercy of God to them. God did not in vaine ſend <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>

Theſe ſcoffing men, that they might procure enuy to vs, doe boaſtingly caſt out theſe things among the vnskilfull common people, and doe raiſe bubbles in
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:11390:241"/>a ſhell, which are blowne away with the leaſt breath.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX. They alſo heape together reproachfull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, falſely attributing thoſe things to vs which we doe not beleeue: <hi>To wit,</hi> that God calleth thoſe who are not conuerted, purpoſely and onely for this end, that they might be inexcuſable: Which thing, farre be it from vs that wee ſhould ſay. Wee ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede that this doth happen, but wee doe not ſay, that this is the onely end propounded by God. Wee doe not thinke that the reprobates are onely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called that they might be made inexcuſable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by deſpiſing that calling they bring greater damnation vpon themſelues. God indeede doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Goſpell to thoſe that will reiect it, but not to that end that they might reiect it. The end propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to God in calling thoſe whom hee knoweth will not obey, is to require that which they owe, and to declare what is acceptable to him. Doth hee not alſo call, warne, and threaten them, that at the leaſt they might be ſo much conſtrained by feare, that they might not hurt thoſe that are good; And that by the example of their ſtubborneneſſe, which goeth not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, the godly might learne to feare, and by comparing their condition with thoſe to whom God hath not vouchſafed the like grace, they might more earneſtly loue God for the prerogatiue granted to them?</p>
               <p n="20">XX. Theſe Sectaries obiect againe, <hi>That by this meanes, ſome men haue matter and cauſe of ſecurity mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to them, and of the contempt of thoſe meanes which God is wont to vſe to worke conuerſion, ſuch as are the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:11390:242"/>preaching of the word, &amp;c. For if no man can conuert himſelfe before this vnreſiſtible drawing, and as ſoone as he is vnreſiſtibly drawne he muſt needes be altogether conuerted, then all our care and diligence is voide and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: And to others there is matter of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall doubtings miniſtred as long as they feele no ſuch drawing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We haue already aduertiſed that this opinion is falſely laid vpon vs. That God doth draw a man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly. We onely ſay, that the elect, although they may reſiſt a long time, yet at length they obey God calling, and their voluntary conuerſion is wrought certainely and infallibly, and that it cannot come to paſſe that they ſhould neuer be conuerted, or being conuerted, that they ſhould finally fall away, and the grace of God ſhould be at length extinguiſhed, and be finally ouercome by the reſiſtance of the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. We deny, that ſecurity or contempt of the word can follow from ſuch drawing, ſeeing that that grace it ſelfe doth create in vs care and diligence. See I pray, how ill theſe things ſquare together, and how vnfitly it is ſaid that the grace of God doth hinder godly carefulneſſe, ſeeing that this carefulneſſe it ſelfe is a part of grace: For how ſhould grace, by which a man is regenerated, corrupt him? Or how ſhould grace, by which he is ſtirred vp and pricked forward, giue him ouer to a languiſhing idleneſſe? Therefore they doe, as if I ſhould ſay, that a man is killed by the reſurrection, or that hee is blacked ouer with a white colour: For they ſay that negligence is brought by that grace which doth beget godly care.</p>
               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:11390:242"/>
               <p n="22">XXII. And there is no doubt but that the ſame abſurdity may be drawne from the opinion of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> whereby he thinkes that ſome men are drawne of God by a congruent and agreeable manner and time, by which, they that are called doe moſt certainly follow. For I may ſay that by this doctrine mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are caſt into a deep ſleep: for there wil be ſome men who will ſpeake thus: To what purpoſe is it to be carefull? Our endeauor is in vaine if we are not drawn after a congruent manner. And I doubt whether I am drawne after a congruent manner, or no. Hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth negligence, and a faith floating in vncertainty.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. That is no better which they adde, <hi>That to ſome men there is matter of perpetuall doubtings ſo long as they feele no ſuch drawing.</hi> This abſurdity is very abſurdly vrged by the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who, with all their power, doe impugne the certainty of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whileſt they command men to doubt of perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For let vs imagine that doubtings of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are bred by this our doctrine: Doe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne that in vs which they alow in themſelues? Wee doe not deny that doubtings doe ſometimes creepe on godly and good men, but yet thoſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings muſt needes diminiſh little by little, as they are more affected with the ſence of the grace of God, and as their faith is increaſed. But it is not needefull that he who is already conuerted and doth beleeue, ſhould feele himſelfe to be drawne vnreſiſtibly, <hi>that is,</hi> to be ſo drawne as he cannot reſiſt. For wee place the infallible certainty of conuerſion not in the ſence of man, who doth feele that hee cannot reſiſt, but in the decree of God, by which it muſt needes be that
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:11390:243"/>they come to Chriſt whom hee hath elected to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So the cauſe that the bones of Chriſt could not be broken, was not in the hardneſſe of thoſe bones, but in the purpoſe of God, who forbad they ſhould be broke. And therefore it may come to paſſe, that they who ſhall certainely be ſaued by the decree of God, doe not certainely know of their ſaluation, and are often troubled with riſing doubts. There are ſome to whom, after many yeeres of their life led ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and godly, the confidence of ſaluation is at laſt giuen them at their death. Nor is it needefull that the faithfull man ſhould trie himſelfe whether hee be drawne with an vnreſiſtible power, but whether after ſerious and earneſt repentance hee doth ſo wholy reſt himſelfe in the death of Chriſt, and in the promiſe of God, that thereby he might be ſtirred vp to piety, and to the feare of God. Whoſoeuer doth feele himſelfe to be thus affected, ought not ſcrupulouſly to weigh and examine the poyſes and drammes of the efficacy of the ſpirit of God, and of vnconquerable grace, but ſo to order himſelfe, that he may repreſſe his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing doubts by prayer, and by the remembrance of the promiſes of God, and that hee may breake and bruiſe the ſerpentine power of his luſts reſiſting the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. And if any one doth otherwiſe, we are not they who can preuent all euils, or cure vices; knowing that by the beſt documents and leſſons, the occaſion of ſinning may be taken, and that the beſt things may be wreſted to the worſe part.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. I omit, that theſe Sectaries ioyne thoſe things which cannot be coupled together, and doe
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:11390:243"/>make thoſe things appoſite and agreeing, which are oppoſite and diſagreeing. For they faigne, that hee that hath true faith, may doubt whether he be ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indeede conuerted. Which ſurely is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for true faith doth ſtirre vp in man, ſerious and true repentance, and the loue of God, which cannot be in man but it muſt be felt.</p>
               <p n="26">XXVI. Finally, the diſcommodities which theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries doe pick out of our doctrine may be auoided: but the doctrine of the <hi>Arminians</hi> doth enwrap mens conſciences, in vnauoydable euills. For hereby is man puffed vp with pride, teaching, that man can ſeparate himſelfe: that he can conuert himſelf: that he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert himſelf before he be conuerted in act by God: that man hath wherof he may boaſt: that God is bound to giue him ſufficient grace: that God doth giue to man, what he is indebted to him: that the grace of God is not the totall cauſe of faith: that the grace of God is ſubiected to mans free-will. And on the other ſide <hi>Arminianiſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> doth vexe mens conſciences with a carefull doubting. For who can be certaine of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, if our ſaluation is not certaine by the election and decree of God? And if the number of the elect be not certaine by the will of God? Or if God hath elected no man, but being conſidered as already dead? Or if the certainty of ſaluation doth reſt on the ſtrength of free-will, in the power whereof it is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere, or not to perſeuere? to beleeue or not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue? to cauſe that God ſhould be partaker of his deſire, or ſhould faile of his propounded end? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if there be place giuen to this deadly doctrine, faith and Chriſtian humilitie is loſt. For it muſt needs
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:11390:244"/>be that they muſt be moſt doubtfull, who are moſt proud. It muſt needes be that the expectation of thoſe men muſt hang in ſuſpence, who make the will of man, a floating and vnſtable thing, the foundation of their hope. Surely Satan doth therefore puffe vp theſe men with pride, that they might be burſt in pieces, and doth lift them vp on high, that being caſt downe from on high, he might more grieuouſly break them and cruſh them to pieces.</p>
               <p n="27">XXVII. But to that our obiection, by which we ſaid, That if God doth worke in vs onely by the manner of perſwaſion, he is not the efficient cauſe of faith, but onely the ſtirrer vp thereof by the manner of an obiect; as Satan himſelfe doth make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, who is not the efficient cauſe of the ſinne of man, although he doth ſtirre vp and inſtigate, and worke effectually in the ſonnes of rebellion; to this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Arminians</hi> anſwere nothing: But they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect on the contrary ſide, <hi>If God</hi> (ſay they) <hi>doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert thoſe which are his (which are farre the leſſer part) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſistibly, and Satan doth auert and turne away the greater part reſiſtibly, therin Satan is of more power then God, who by leſſe and inferiour helpes can execute his purpoſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more men.</hi> Theſe good men doe alwaies put that their word <hi>vnreſiſtibly,</hi> for <hi>certainely</hi> and <hi>infallibly.</hi> But to the purpoſe, I deny that they whom God doth draw and effectually conuert, are fewer then they whom Satan doth auert and turne away. Indeede it is not to be doubted but that ſome in the beginnings of their conuerſion, are remoued from that beginning by the ſubtlety of Satan; But theſe are but few in compariſon of them who neuer felt any aſſaults, or
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:11390:244"/>pricks of repentance: Satan doth not auert theſe, ſeeing theſe are auerſe by their owne nature. And whatſoeuer Satan doth is but ſmall in compariſon of the efficacy of the ſpirit of God in the elect. For Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan found men prone to ſinne, and thruſt them fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that were falling; nor is it any doubt but that the reprobates are not carried ſo much by the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Satan, as by their owne. Certainly it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing to heale a few that are deadly wounded, then to exacerbate and make more angry &amp; grieuous the wounds of many, and to poure vinegar on the Vlcer: It is farre more eaſie to thruſt them forward that are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, then to raiſe them that are fallen: to kill ten that are about to die, then to reſtore one to life that is dead.</p>
               <p n="28">XXVIII. And here they exclaime, that mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is auerted and ouerthrowne, while it is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined and limited to one thing. I anſwere; If by the word <hi>neceſsitie</hi> be vnderſtood not conſtraint nor naturall neceſſitie (ſuch as is the poiſe and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all heauy things to the center of the world,) but an infallible certainty, and that voluntary and ſpontaneus, by ſuch a neceſſity nature is not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. The nature of Angels is neceſſarily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and limited to that which is good, and yet it is not therefore ouerthrowne. Our nature is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined and directed to the deſiring of felicity, and yet it is not therefore deſtroyed. The will of the Iſraelites, whoſe hearts God touched, that they ſhould cleaue vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.26. The will of <hi>Eſau</hi> yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with a ſuddaine change to the embracing of his brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. The will of the Thiefe crucified with Chriſt; and of <hi>Paul,</hi> in the very point of conuerſion,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:11390:245"/>were determined &amp; limited to one thing; and yet force was not therefore offered to their free-will, or their nature deſtroyed. The vehemency of him that is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie mouing him to the drinke that is offered, is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and limited to that one thing, and yet he doth not therefore ceaſe to be a man, nor is his nature therefore ouerthrowne. God hath ſome ſecret and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceiueable meanes, by which he can bow mans will, the liberty thereof being vntouched.</p>

               <p>The ſame man, <hi>page</hi> 819. <hi>The pleaſure or will of God calling, is his purpoſe according to election in Chriſt:</hi> that is, <hi>the purpoſe of God, whereby out of the periſhed maſſe he ſeperated ſome from others, by chooſing theſe and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the reſt: which purpoſe is called Predeſtination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining vnder it, Election and Abiection.</hi>

               <p>The Paſtors of the <hi>Walachrian</hi> Churches, in their Epiſtle, doe with one conſent thus define Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>This is the opinion of them who cleaue to the old and receiued confeſsion of our Churches. That God from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity according to the immutable good pleaſure of his will, decreed to ſaue ſome men, whom by his meere bounty in Chriſt Ieſus, he ſeuered out of corrupted mankinde, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Iohn Piſcator,</hi> a moſt rigorous maintainer of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination out of the entire and vncorrupted Maſſe, and of reprobation without the beholding of ſinne, hath very lately ſet forth a treatiſe digeſted into ten
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:11390:248"/>Aphoriſmes, the ſecond whereof is conceiued in theſe words. <hi>This Predeſtination hath two</hi> ſpecies <hi>or kindes, the one whereof is called Election, the other Reprobation, by a Metonimy of the effect. For election and reprobation are properly referred to mankinde already made and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, but Metonimically the decree it ſelfe of Electing or Reprobating is ſo named.</hi> The learned man doth at length ſee that it muſt needes be, that in election and reprobation, man be conſidered as already fallen, and in the corrupted Maſſe: But he hath deuiſed another higher decree, whereby God doth neither elect nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, but doth only decree to elect and reprobate. Of which decree there is no mention made in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Finally, the Synode of <hi>Dordt,</hi> in the ſeuenth Canon doth thus define election. <hi>Election is the vnchangeable purpoſe of God, by which, before the foundation of the world, according to the free good pleaſure of his will, of his meere grace he hath choſen out of all mankinde to ſaluation in Chriſt, a certaine and ſet number of men, neither better nor more worthy then others, but lying in the common mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery with others, and fallen from originall righteouſneſſe into ſinne and deſtruction by their owne fault, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Fathers in the 15. Canon of Reprobation doe thus ſpeake. <hi>The holy Scripture doth manifeſt and commend vnto vs this eternall and free grace, eſpecially when it doth further witneſſe that not all men are elected, but that ſome are not elected, or are paſſed by in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall election of God.</hi> To wit, <hi>thoſe whom God according to his free, iuſt, vnreprouable, and immutable good pleaſure decreed to leaue in the common miſery, into which they had caſt themſelues by their owne fault, and not to giue to them ſauing faith, and the grace of conuerſion, &amp;c.</hi>
